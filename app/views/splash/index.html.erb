      <li>We have a <i>bunch</i> of exciting features (course wishlists, search-by-rating, etc)
        in the works that we'll hopefully be rolling out soon, so <em>stay tuned</em>
        and be sure to tell us what you think of them.

    <h2>Features in the works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Wishlists</strong>. Ever found a class that you know you want to take _eventually_, but
      this just isn't the right term? Well, wishlists should help solve that.

      <li> <strong>Search by review rating</strong>. Looking for a class with a light
      workload? Or thinking about taking a class in a new department and want to know who the
      beloved, must-have profs are?

      <li> <strong>Review break-downs</strong>. Break a classes' reviews down between majors
      and non-majors, or students scoring above and below the median (for instance).

      <li> <strong>Better! Faster! Stronger!</strong>. We're hoping to move the
        site to a faster server soon. If you experience any slowness, I guess just be
        patient. A faster site is coming!
