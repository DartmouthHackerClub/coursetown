      To get started, either
      <%= link_to %(search for classes you've taken), search_path, :class => 'big' %> or use
      the incredibly convenient new <%= link_to 'Quick Review Tool', quick_start_reviews_path, :class => 'big' %>

    <h2>Note: This site is in Beta</h2>
    <p>

      We built this site because we thought the other ones sucked, and we
      know you agree. <%= link_to 'SA Course Guide', 'http://hacktown.cs.dartmouth.edu/gudru' -%>
      makes writing reviews a <em>chore</em>, and somehow reading them is almost
      as laborious. <%= link_to 'Course Rank', 'https://www.courserank.com/dartmouth/main' %>,
      on the other hand, is <em>too</em> simple (and it's not very useful
      without the old review data). We tried to design a new site with all the
      criticism we'd heard from campus in mind, but we know it isn't
      perfect yet.

    <h2>Features in the works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Wishlists</strong>. Ever found a class that you know you want to take _eventually_, but
      this just isn't the right term? Well, wishlists should help solve that.

      <li> <strong>Search by review rating</strong>. Looking for a class with a light
      workload? Or thinking about taking a class in a new department and want to know who the
      beloved, must-have profs are?

      <li> <strong>Review break-downs</strong>. Break a classes' reviews down between majors
      and non-majors, or students scoring above and below the median (for instance).

      <li> <strong>Better! Faster! Stronger!</strong>. We're hoping to move the
        site to a faster server soon. If you experience any slowness, I guess just be
        patient. A faster site is coming!
