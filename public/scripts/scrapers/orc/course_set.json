The most prominent among these themes are love (patriotic, familial, romantic, and platonic) and social protest. Individual literary genres in China have traditionally been associated, in a general way, with historical/dynastic periods. Therefore, tracing the evolution, for example, of the theme of romantic love will lead the student through the multiplicity of ways that an idea can be transformed by diverse literary mediums and different historical periods. In reaching a fundamental understanding through literature of the Chinese way of looking at a specific idea as it evolved over time, we will understand better the uniqueness of both Chinese values and institutions. Courses listed under Chinese 63 are open to students of all classes.\n\nIn 10F (63.4), Martial Heroines in Chinese Literature. In traditional China, there was strict separation between women’s and men’s functions and activities. Women were expected to participate in the domestic, inner sphere, running a household and bringing up children, while men participated in the public, outer sphere of administration, the military and business. However, though martial activities such as participation in war and acts of knight-errantry were traditionally male activities, Chinese literature boasted a long tradition of fighting women of various types. This course introduces stories of heroines and martial women in traditional literature, juxtaposed against traditional formulation of female functions, and their evolution and modern representation in film and literature.\n\nIn 11S (63.1), Storytelling in China. This course attempts to provide the student with both a general understanding of the nature of oral, performed narrative and a specific grasp of the pre-modern and contemporary oral tradition in China. The course naturally divides itself into three parts: readings in English, from both the general folklore tradition and performance theory specifically, and from the history of Chinese oral performed narrative; analysis of videotaped performances from among China’s most renowned storytellers; and the creation and performance of three versions of a short narrative in English.\n\nIn 12W (63.2), Women in China. This is a survey course of Chinese ideas and practices concerning women. The pursuit of this theme will take the student through a wide variety of Chinese literary genres and materials, including the classics, poetry, fiction, drama, biography, and law. The use of women as a focus in the organization of the course provides the selectivity that makes such comprehensiveness possible. The aim is to provide the student with an intimate portrait of the development of Chinese culture as a whole through the examination of one of its central systems. The course is designed with the presumption that an understanding of Chinese thoughts about women will lead to an enhanced understanding of Chinese thoughts about Chinese people and life in general.

Diego Velasquez, sometimes called the prince of painters, was Spain’s preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV. The class will study in depth many of Velazquez’s key works and examine how he challenged previous notions about the nature of representation, and simultaneously sought to demonstrate the “nobility” of painting.\n\nIn 11W, “The Villa Life”: Andrea Palladio and His Architectural Legacy. Historians routinely identify Andrea Palladio, the 16th-century Italian architect, as architecture’s most celebrated designer. For one who never left Italy and whose reputation depends on a small number of built works and the repeated publication and translation of a single book, such abiding esteem is an astonishing achievement. In this course, we will study Palladio’s splendid Veneto villas and his influential Four Books of Architecture in search of the reasons for his great prominence.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 10A, Books as Art: Renaissance and Baroque Illustrated Books at Dartmouth. This class examines rare illustrated books in the rich collection in Dartmouth’s Rauner Library. We will focus on the necessity or effectiveness of book illustration, the relation between text and image, book illustrations as works of art and as conveyors of knowledge.

Abstract Expressionism, the first American artistic movement to gain international recognition, embodied many conflicts and paradoxes. Steeping themselves in earlier European modernism, the artists nonetheless pursued a style that was to be a-historical in its immediacy. They aimed to address the most profound questions of civilization solely through acts of spontaneity. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Pollock, Gorky, DeKooning, Rothko, and others amidst the complexities of American culture of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 11F, Mexican Muralism (identical to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies 48). This survey course introduces students to Mexican muralism.  Students will learn about the fresco technique and how to visually analyze a mural.  We will consider the following themes: cultural nationalism; art and class politics; the legacy of muralism in the US; the ethics of aesthetic indigenism; and the gender politics of public art. Student projects will concentrate of Jose Clemente Orozco’s mural at Dartmouth College. \n\nIn 12S, The Blue Rider Group. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) was an international group of expressionists whose work was centered in Munich, around 1912.

Issues include the Grand Tour, the French and American Revolutions, the aesthetic of power, utopian politics, the beautiful and the picturesque. Artists include David, Canova, Adam, Reynolds, Jefferson, and others.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 11, Michelangelo. Michelangelo Buonarroti, called “Il Divino” in his own lifetime, was the dominant practitioner of painting, sculpture and architecture in sixteenth-century Italy. This course will focus on Michelangelo’s most famous creations in the light of recent restorations and new scholarship. Finally, we will look at the intersection of his visual works with his biography: how these works relate to Michelangelo’s creation of his own image, chiefly through the works of his biographers Vasari and Condivi.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 12, The Archaeology of Israel: from Prehistory to the Roman Period (Identical to, and described under, Jewish Studies 41.1).\n\nIn 11X, Sculpture (pending faculty approval).

Genetic variation underlies much of the diseases that afflict us, but how do differences at the level of DNA translate into differences in health? How can we find genes underlying such disorders? In “DNA to Disease” we will focus on a small number of human genetic diseases, some of which are caused by defects in a single gene while others result from defects in multiple genes. Our analysis of these diseases will span from the molecular level to the population level. We will explore how genes and proteins function in cells, how cells communicate, and how these molecular and cellular mechanisms become defective in human disease. We will investigate how mutations arise, how disease alleles behave in populations, and how physicians and geneticists are exploiting human genetic variation to map the genetic bases of disease.

Over the course of the last 4.5 billion years, life has faced a number of challenges, and in response has evolved a number of remarkable innovations to meet those challenges. Incorporating data and perspectives from molecular and cellular biology, macroevolutionary theory, and paleobiology, we will reconstruct the biology of the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all living organisms. Her name is LUCA and unraveling her biology will require us to work within the framework of what it means to be a living cell. We will move forward in time from the origin of life, and backward in time from the remarkable diversity of life present today. We will see that much of LUCA’s biology has left “molecular fossils” in our very own DNA, and we will learn how to read this remarkable fossil record.

Dynamic interactions between rapidly evolving infectious agents and changes in the environment and in host behavior provide such agents with favorable new ecological niches.

The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult.

The contexts of the colonial encounter and its postcolonial aftermath will set the stage for our examination of the ways in which social, political, economic, and cultural factors foster the production of specific masculinities. Texts include Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Lafferiere’s How to Make Love to a Negro, and additional writings by Irish, Indian, and Australian authors. Our study will be organized around the questions of the production of hegemonic and subaltern masculinities, the representation of the colonial and postcolonial male body, the militarization of masculinity, and the relation between masculinity and nationalism.

This course examines the book as a material and cultural object. We’ll consider various practical and theoretical models for understanding the book form and investigating the materials, technologies, institutions, and practices of its production, dissemination, and reception. We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also spend time talking about the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience in the Book Arts workshop setting type.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 3), Evidence of Things Not Seen: Advanced Creative Nonfiction. Through close readings of creative nonfiction, we’ll investigate craft—character, voice, structure, and sequence—as well as parable, myth, and allusion, the intangible “facts” at the heart of the genre. We’ll conduct our inquiry through excursions into faith, doubt, and the territory in between. Our goal is to learn how to inhabit the ideas and experience of “belief,” broadly defined, an essential step in writing nonfiction stories that transcend their journalistic foundations.\n\nIn 11W at 2 (section 4), The Poetics of Literary Practice. Designed for students interested in the intersections of literary study, theory, and the practice of creative writing, this course explores how modern and contemporary poets have thought about their own art. How do underlying theories about language, art, culture, and history inform a poet’s literary practice? Students will develop their own creative and critical writing practices, participate in workshop critique, compose responses to the selected readings, and complete an essay that explores their own poetics.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (section 5), Some Elements of Drama. Traversing ten plays and a range of critical responses to theater and performance, the course entertains questions concerning the purpose of theater, the fascination and anxiety it occasions, and the complex dynamics among players, playgoers and playtexts, exploring what drama does for—and to—audiences. A playlist including Sophocles and Shakespeare, but also Beckett, Pirandello, Pinter and Churchill, challenges and expands upon issues raised by theorists from Plato’s time to the present.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 6), Writers at Work. This course will explore how cultural stories shape the identities of writers and inform their work. We will read writers on their writing process, looking at how their contexts inform and shape their stories. We will read and discuss such writers as: Toni Morrison, J.D. Salinger, T. Olsen, W. Faulkner, and T.T. Williams. The overarching goal of the course will be to help students to develop a concrete writing process, gaining voice and self-consciousness within their own cultural stories. Students will be encouraged to write not only about other writers’ writing process but about their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 7), The Poem in Context. A noted American writer allegedly boasted, “I don’t read books; I write them.” This course is for another kind of writer, the kind who ponders questions such as: what happens in a poem? why do some move us so intensely that we learn them by heart? how do they change the way we think? As we write and read 20th century poems, we will reflect on the assumptions that shape them and will examine their historical and social contexts. As we write and read theory and criticism, we will try to make the practical and theoretical aspects of the art cohere."},{"instances":{},"subject":"ENGL","number":"62","section":null,"title":"Gender/Literature/Culture","offered":"11S: 12","distribs":["LIT"],"wcults":[],"profs":[[""],["WCult: CI"],["CA tags Genders and Sexualities"],["Cultural Studies and Popular Culture"],["Colleen Glenney Boggs"]],"note":null,"description":"In 11S at 12 (section 1), Animals and Women in Western Literature: Nags, Bitches, and Shrews  (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 60).

Why are women and animals so often excluded from subjectivity and from ethical consideration, and how have women responded to their identification with animals?

This class will also study particular games, and, in addition to writing essays, students will invent individual and group projects in the game domain.\n\nIn 11S at 2 (section 2), National Allegory: Readings in Postcolonial Literature and Culture (Identical to Comparative Literature 49). This course explores current theories of nationalism and postnationalism and how these theories could be productively utilized in making sense of literary texts from the postcolonial world.

This course will examine each of two plays as an actor’s script. The class should be attractive both to students who just enjoy drama and to those specifically interested in performing, directing, or writing plays.\n\nIn 11W at 10 (section 2), 1611.

This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2). We define and transform ourselves through stories. In this community-based learning course, students will alternate studying narratives of prison, addiction, and recovery in the traditional classroom with travel to Valley Vista, a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Bradford, Vermont, where they will participate in a program for women patients whose goal is the creation and performance of an original production that will facilitate the patients’ voices. Written work for the course will combine critical analysis and self-reflection.\n\nIn 11W at 11 (section 3), Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native Literature and Film (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 32).\n\nIn 11S at 11 (section 4), Woolfenstein (Identical to WGST 53). In her well known passage from A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf stated that “we think back through our mothers if we are women”; twenty years later, Gertrude Stein would obliquely refer to herself as “the mother of us all.” These two women occupy a central place in European and American modernism, their work having influenced successive generations of writers. Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory. Suggested background courses are English 15, Comparative Literature 72, WGST 16.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 5), African Literatures: Masterpieces of Literature From Africa (Identical to African and African American Studies 51 and Comparative Literature 51. Described under Comparative Literature 51).\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 9), Faulkner. In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. Readings include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and other.\n\nSeminars are designed as small courses, limited to twelve students, primarily seniors; qualified juniors may enroll. These courses emphasize discussion, and allow the student to develop his or her thinking about a subject throughout the term. Though assignments vary according to the nature of the material being studied, seminars usually involve class presentations and a term paper. They fulfill the “Culminating Experience” requirement. Prerequisite: at least four completed major courses, of which one must be in the same course group as the seminar. Students who successfully complete a seminar may sometimes be allowed to follow it with a one-term Honors project (see the section on Honors, above)."},{"instances":{},"subject":"ENGL","number":"70","section":null,"title":"Literature Before the Mid-Seventeenth Century","offered":"10F, 11W, 11S: 2A","distribs":["LIT"],"wcults":["W,pendingfacultyapproval","W","W"],"profs":[["Course Group I"],["CA tags Genre-drama"],["National Traditions and Countertraditions"],["Lynda E.

England first emerges as a nation-state under the Tudor monarchs, and Shakespeare’s creation and dissemination of the myths of origin within his history plays was crucial in enabling people to imagine a shared “Englishness.” We will focus on the 8 plays that span the approximate 75 year Wars of the Roses, running from the deposition of Richard II to the fall of Richard III and the ascendancy of the first Tudor monarch, Henry VII.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 2), Medieval Animals. From bestiary collections to theological tracts, from scholastic debates between birds to trickster heroes such as Reynard the fox, medieval literature is full of meaningful animals. This course will examine the significance of a variety of medieval “animal” texts, ranging from The Book of Beasts and the Physiologus to Marie de France’s Fables and Chaucer’s The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. We will also consider recent theoretical studies of the “animal” in culture as well as corollary American critters such as Coyote and the Signifying Monkey.\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 3), Thomas Middleton: Dramatist. Middleton was one of the most prolific and brilliant dramatists of the seventeenth century, writing concurrently with Shakespeare and Jonson. A consummate professional, he wrote with equal distinction in tragedy (The Revenger’s Tragedy, The Changeling, Women Beware Women), comedy (A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, The Roaring Girl), satires and masques. Middleton’s career is fascinating study in the history and conditions of seventeenth century performance, solo and collaborative authorship, and dramatic styles.

This class explores Naturalism’s key texts and contexts in works by Dreiser, Norris, Stephen Crane, Charles Chesnutt, Edith Wharton, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Ellen Glasgow, Jack London, John Steinbeck, and Richard Wright.\n\nIn 10F at 12 (section 2), Bohemia and the 19th Century Novel. By the 1890s, the figure of the Bohemian had become central to a cosmopolitan literary culture eager to assert its autonomy from the marketplace and a restrictive notion of Englishness. It also evoked a range of anxieties bound up with cultural decadence, racial degeneration, transgressive sexuality and the occult.

Each student will be asked to write two papers.\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 1), Science, Fiction and Empire. This course investigates how scientific knowledge production contributes to powerful narratives we tell about the body, gender, race, and sexuality, for example. Students critically examine a number of science fiction novels, short stories, and films as well as a broader set of scientific fictions pulled from popular and institutional media. We also explore the historical relationships between science and imperialism, exploration and discovery, conquest and the mining of natural resources. Engaging with postcolonial, feminist, and queer theory, students also read in the field of science studies.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 2), Toni Morrison This course is an intensive study of Toni Morrison’s major fictional works.

The requirement may be fulfilled in one of three ways: by taking a course devoted to the study of European literature or the history of the English language; by taking a course in a field clearly relevant to the study of literature in English (e.g., history, art history, philosophy, media studies); by taking a course that immerses the student in some aspect of Scottish, British, or Celtic language, literature, culture or history. This course must be approved by the program director. On the Trinidad FSP, this will be a course of study in West Indian history and culture. On the Dublin FSP, this will be a course of study in the English Department at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Of the three courses at TCD at least one must be in Irish literature.

We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms? How will politicians and businesses seek to understand and influence the preferences of the public as technological changes produce new opportunities and challenges regarding interactions with the public?

For decades the Arab Gulf states—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—were viewed both economically and politically as anomalies, utterly dependent on world oil markets for their development, conservative if not backward, and marked by highly authoritarian regimes.  However, the creation within the region of the Gulf Cooperation Council as an economic bloc, and the emergence of Dubai as a post-oil financial and commercial center for the region, are clear indicators of the changing economic (and perhaps political) fortunes of the local countries.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Globalization and Global Development, The latest wave of economic globalization has differently affected various regions of the world. One of the most often repeated (and disputed) assertions is that the economic power of the United States is fading and that the fortunes of the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as well as other selected Emerging Economies (“the Second World”) will mark the dawn of a more equal and, economically speaking, a more balanced global economy. The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis—and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention."},{"instances":{},"subject":"GOVT","number":"41","section":null,"title":"Democracy, European Style","offered":"11S, 12S: 10A","distribs":["SOC","INT"],"wcults":["W"],"profs":[["Sa’adah"]],"note":null,"description":"An intensive study of the political development, institutions, and behavior of selected West European countries.

Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis."},{"instances":{},"subject":"GOVT","number":"51","section":null,"title":"International Law","offered":"Not offered in 2010-2011 may be offered in 2011-2012","distribs":["INT"],"wcults":[],"profs":[["W"],["William C.

Topics include toleration, constitutionalism, rights, individualism, and slavery. Readings are drawn mainly from primary sources, including Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Hamilton, Jackson, Calhoun, Taylor, Anthony, Thoreau, and Lincoln.\n\nIn 10F and 11F at 10, Ethics and Public Policy (Identical to Public Policy 42). This course examines the nature and validity of arguments about vexing moral issues in public policy.  Students examine a number of basic moral controversies in public life, focusing on different frameworks for thinking about justice and he ends of politics.  The primary aim of the course is to provide each student with an opportunity to develop his/her ability to think in sophisticated ways about morally difficult policy issues.  Amount the questions students address will be the following:  Are policies that permit torture justifiable under any circumstances?  Do people have basic moral claims to unequal economic holdings and rewards, or should economic distribution be patterned for the sake of social justice?  Should people be permitted to move freely between countries?   Is abortion wrong, in theory or in practice, and in what ways should it be restricted?\n\nIn 11W at 10A and 11X at 2A, Immigration, Asylum and Politics. This course examines the topic of immigration and asylum from a political, social, legal and public policy perspective. As a nation of immigrants, much of our self-identity is bound up in the idea that we are forever the “unfinished” nation. What does this mean? How are our views and policies on immigration different from those of other nations with different identities and histories? How do we address the problems of security and the need (both in law and philosophy) to provide a safe haven to those who seek asylum from persecution elsewhere?\n\nIn 11S at 2A, Democratic Theory. Can we defend the value of democracy against serious and thoughtful criticism? Using a combination of classic and contemporary texts, this course encourages students to think rigorously about one of their most basic political values. It examines the origins of democratic theory in ancient Athenian political practice and the normative and practical criticisms of more contemporary thinkers. What makes politics “democratic?” What features distinguish the democratic regime from other regimes? What is democracy supposed to reflect or achieve? And what kinds of concerns about democracy did ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle raise? How (and why) did early modern and Enlightenment thinkers relocate the grounds for preferring democracy to other regimes? Dist; TMV, WCult: W.\n\nIn 11S at 2A and 12S at 10A, Ethics, Everyday Life and Law. What is the right thing to do? What is the best way of life? How, if at all, should the answers to these questions bear on politics and law? Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier—or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the “pursuit of happiness” as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens? These questions will be investigated through readings that move between the history of moral and political thought (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill) and cases and questions drawn from contemporary life.\n\nIn 11F at 12, Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty (Identical to Native American Studies 36). This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples’ experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice. Not open to first-year students without permission of instructor.\n\nIn 11F at 2, Liberalism and Its Critics. Liberal political theory is renowned for its emphasis on rights, freedoms, and limited government; but critics of liberalism hold that the liberal legacy in free societies is one of misguided energies and broken promises. Students in this course chart the development of liberal thought from the Seventeenth Century to the present, with a view to considering the central values and commitments liberals may share, and examining important contemporary work in liberal theory. The course integrates weighty challenges to the moral and political viability of liberalism, from communitarian, conservative, libertarian, and postmodern critics. Government 6 recommended.\n\nIn 11F at 2A, Theorizing Free Speech. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution reads in part: “Congress shall make no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...or the right of the people to peacefully assemble.” This course examines the philosophical and constitutional issues regarding the First Amendment’s speech, press, and association clauses. Readings draw from Supreme Court cases and secondary sources. Areas covered include: philosophical foundations of free speech, compelled speech, defamation, hate speech, expressive discrimination, obscenity and pornography.

The course charts the political struggles over the nature and status of “New World” bound labor from the late eighteenth century British critiques of the African slave trade through the end of plantation slavery in Brazil roughly a hundred years later. Readings will explore both those transnational connections and the multiple actors that helped make these years an “age of emancipation.” Major\n\nIn 11W at 10 (Section 2), Gender and Sexuality: Asians in America. In this course we examine the ascendance of sexuality and gender as primary categories for organizing Asian American identities in the media, economy, law, and in politics. Between 1875 and 1943, Asian women were special targets for immigration exclusion and sexual policing. This shaped the possibilities for both men’s and women’s citizenship, employment, and reproduction. Other events shaping Asian American gendered and sexual economies that we will review include wars, imperialism, globalization, and military expansion.

Although infections usually require the presence of microscopic pathogens or parasites, the scope of disease outbreaks on a larger scale is always eminently social. As such, historians have a lot to offer microbiologists, doctors, and public health officials in explaining epidemics. In this course, we will examine the politics of addressing disease outbreaks, the institutional and social conditions of possibility for patterns of disease transmission, and finally, the cultural significations diseases have assumed over time. Major\n\nIn 11S at 10 (Section 2), Crusades and Culture 1095-1350. The crusades, launched by European Christians who sought to secure military control over the Holy Land, led to a period of sustained and largely inimical contact between Christian and Muslim cultures. Covering the period from 1095-ca.1350, this course explores the cultural, religious, and ideological contexts of crusade history which shaped notions of religious violence, holy war, and ethnic cleansing, along with a long history of distrust between the peoples of Christian Europe (or the Christian West) and the Islamic Middle East.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Nationalism and Revolution in the Caribbean (Identical to, and described under African and African American Studies 86 and Latin American and Caribbean Studies 54).\n\nIn 11X at 10A, American Transcendentalism in Historical Perspective.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Epidemics in History: Etiologies and Ideologies.\n\nIn 12W at 2, Topics in Native American History.\n\nIn 12W at 10, Gender and Sexuality: Asians in America.\n\nIn 12W at 2A, The Life, Death and Rebirth of Great American Cities.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Topics in Medieval History.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, War and Society in Early America.\n\nIn 12S at 10, History of Vietnam to 1945.\n\nIn 12S at 12, Crusades and Culture 1095-1350.\n\nIn 12S at 2, From Coca to Cocaine: Drug Economies in Latin America."},{"instances":{},"subject":"HIST","number":"7","section":null,"title":"First-Year Seminars in History","offered":"Consult special listings","distribs":[],"wcults":[],"profs":[],"note":null},{"instances":{},"subject":"HIST","number":"10","section":null,"title":"Colonial America","offered":"11W, 12S: 10A","distribs":["SOC"],"wcults":["W"],"profs":[["Major Dist: INTER; <1700"],["<1800"],["Joseph F.

Along with the products of high culture associated with such intellectuals as Augustine, Peter Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, and Thomas Aquinas, we will thus review the fundamental values of medieval society at large and explore ways in which popular and elite culture converged or contrasted.\n\nOpen to all classes."},{"instances":{},"subject":"HIST","number":"44","section":null,"title":"Medieval France, 400-1494","offered":"11S: 12","distribs":["SOC"],"wcults":["W"],"profs":[["Major Dist: EUR; <1700"],["<1800"],["Cecilia Gaposchkin"]],"note":null,"description":"The course traces the medieval foundations of the French nation, from the Roman Era to the end of the fifteenth century, with emphasis on institutional, social, and cultural development.

Enrollment limited to 35 students.\n\nIn 10F at 2A, Sleep and Sleep Disorders. This course will explore the basic biological mechanisms of sleep and circadian rhythms, including neuroanatomical and neurophysiological aspects of sleep/wake, as well as the behavioral and social aspects of normal sleep. The course will then build upon this basic understanding of normal sleep and circadian rhythm to develop an overview of major sleep and circadian rhythm disorders. The importance of sleep to adequate daytime neuropsychological functioning and the social, public policy and economic issues pertinent to sleep and circadian rhythms will be addressed.

Harvard Philosopher George Santayana said “those that cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (Life of Reason, 1905). Is that happening right now in Psychology? The goal of this course is to enrich our understanding of current psychological theory by understanding its intellectual origins. We will trace the origins of the current influential schools of thought in psychology to determine what is really new, and what was anticipated by earlier generations. We will see that early psychologists, without the aid of modern technologies, came up with some incredibly clever ways to solve experimental problems, many supplying answers that have held up to this day. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.  Hughes and Whalen.\n\nIn 11W at 11, The Roles of the Human Fronto-Parietal Network: Executive Control, Planning, Attention, Volition and Mental Causation of Action.\n\nThis course will focus on neural circuitry underlying decision-making, planning, and attention. Inherent to planning and executive control are issues of selection and inhibition from among possible courses of action, evaluation of stimuli, and an assessment of how best to accomplish goals. Our goal will be to shed light on ancient philosophical questions of free will, mental causation, and the mind-body problem by looking at what neuroscience can teach us. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Mind and Brain. It is believed that the mind is a manifestation of the brain. Think of computers. The brain is hardware, the mind is software. Is it possible to understand algorithms of the software by investigating physical activity of the hardware? This course will take the mind and brain problem as a theme to guide discussions about neural underpinnings of various mental phenomena. Cutting-edge research across Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind will be covered.\n\nIn 11S at 2, Attention. In our everyday environment, a massive amount of information pours into our sensory organs, but only a small subset of it reaches awareness. What determines how much information is passed on to higher levels of processing? In this course, we will explore this classic question of capacity limits on human information processing with particular emphasis on the role of attention. Through lectures and discussions, we will examine the cognitive and neural mechanisms of attention.

We start by covering the main principles of evolution and Darwin’s most extraordinary insight: the evolution of all species from a single, common ancestor. Then we make the important causal connection to our minds by building up from genes to mind. We next consider how sex and reproductive strategies influence male and female behavior in a variety of species, including humans. We then examine the evolutionary influences on family life, and look to child development for evidence of innate knowledge. Limitations in our cognitive processing, and universals in social and emotional processing provide further evidence for evolved adaptations.

In a fleeting glance, we can identify a person, infer their emotional state, determine their gender, estimate their age, assess their attractiveness, andsurmise the focus of their thoughts. Social perception is fundamental to social interaction in humans as well as other animals. This course will examine social perception in humans and other species and in doing so will touch on issues including functional specialization and neurocognitive development and evolution. Faces have received much of the attention in social perception and we’ll spend significant time on face perception, but we’ll also cover body perception, biological motion perception, voice perception, and some of the various types of social perception in non-human animals.

Understanding the nature of self-what it is and what it does-has challenged scholars for many centuries. Although most people intuitively understand what is meant by the term self, definitions have tended toward the philosophical and metaphysical. Efforts at creating more formal definitions have largely been unsuccessful, as many features of self are empirically murky, difficult to identify and assess using objective methods. Yet the phenomenological experience of self is highly familiar to everyone. So, at issue is not whether the self exists, but how best to study it. This course will survey contemporary approaches to understanding the self, with a strong emphasis on approaches from social psychology. We will consider self’s development, its cognitive and affective components, motives related to it, and how it is regulated.

Their travels confronted them with physical and cultural realities that challenged every cultural assumption, every category of the real. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the first task of the discoverer was to organize a new vision, processing a flood of color, sound and light that threatened to overcome his resistance and impose a new autonomous system of perception and representation. His second task would be to come to grips with that radical otherness. Comparisons and contrasts would provide the first basic tool for “understanding” the Other and his world. They would also set the stage for legitimate appropriation of an ‘Other” that would be found lacing and inferior in the comparative process of apprehension.
