The figure of characters in crisis has been the foundation of literary plots since Antiquity. This course examines cinematic, literary, and philosophical representations of people coming undone while working their ways through crises that threaten their lives. Why has this problem always been so prevalent in narratives of all kinds? Works by Plato, Nietzsche, Nabokov, the Coen brothers, Wallace, Almod&#243;var, Borges, Shakespeare, Dickinson, and others.

From Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s <em>Little Match Girl</em> to the young protagonists of Danny Boyle&#8217;s <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, the street child as a fictional character embodies a range of anxieties about modern society. In order to investigate this issue, we will examine texts of different periods, geographical locations, and genres from a variety of theoretical perspectives.

He robbed the rich to provide for the poor and fight against injustice and tyranny. From Robin Hood via actual and legendary robbers, pirates, and corsair in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, to present day pirates, terrorists and guerilla groups in Somalia, Latin America, Italy, Germany, and the U.S., individuals have always been involved in what they considered legitimate (though illegal) resistance against poverty, authority, patriarchy, feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism. Their rebellion (or criminal action?) evokes a question that has already been at the center of Aeschylus&#8217; <em>Orestes</em>: what legitimizes individual justice versus socially controlled jurisdiction; what distinguishes vigilantism from politics, or antinomianism from legalism? Starting from the political and philosophical dichotomy between legitimacy and legality&#8212;what is ethically or religiously legitimate isn&#8217;t necessarily legal, and vice versa&#8212;this course will focus on representations of rebels and outlaws in different cultural contexts, historical periods, and cultural genres such as novels, movies, dramas, diaries, and operas.

Human population growth and increasing rates of material consumption and technological development have increased the rate and scale at which we impact populations of native animals and plants. One goal of the course will be to address the biological aspects of this issue. What is Biodiversity? How is Biodiversity distributed geographically and taxonomically? What does humankind do to cause animal and plant extinctions? Is there a Biodiversity crisis? What is the current rate of extinction and what is the natural extinction rate? What properties of individual species make them vulnerable to extinction? What are the major threats to Biodiversity? The second objective is to examine the social dimensions of Biodiversity. How do our cultural and political perceptions and institutions contribute to the loss of Biodiversity? What value is Biodiversity to humankind? What is being done to preserve Biodiversity in the realms of science, technology, and policy?

The success of environmental law depends upon balancing the three components of sustainability: ecological, economic, and social/cultural. Today, the primary sources of this balancing act are federal, state, and local ordinances and their myriad regulations. However, these statutes and regulations overlay a common, judge-made, law of property that establishes a system of private and public property, a law of contracts that governs transactions, and a tort law that provides remedies for intentional and unintentional harms. In addition, there is a growing body of international environmental law with both similarities and differences to U.S. environmental law. The major objectives of this course are to survey today's major environmental laws, explore their history, determine how well they balance ecological, economic, and social sustainability and, finally, to discuss how to improve environmental law to better deal with biodiversity loss, human population growth, energy needs, and climate change in the future.

on soils; in fact, soils provide nutrients to all ecosystems.  Agriculture and land management has increased soil erosion around the world, potentially influencing the history and fate of civilizations. In the modern era, this use is not sustainable; the physical and chemical degradation of soils far outpaces soil production.  This course will explore the nature and properties of souls and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource.  We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties.  The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems.  The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\r\n</div>", "title": "The Soil Resource", "number": "79", "subject": "ENVS"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p>This course may be offered any term and the content varied according to the interests of the instructor.

The first part of this course covers this historical emergence of middle eastern regimes since the early 1950s. <br>\nIn each country--Libya, Tunisia,Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria--elites have responded differently to the uprising, depending in part on the insittutional repertoire each country possessed. As yet, it is unclear what the different trajectories of each country's period of upheaval will be, but they all share important common political elements and developments: transitional arrangements as the first phase of contestation comes to an end, proposed elections leading to constitution-making processes and to referendums that are meant to introduce--or re-introduce--forms of constitutional government. <br>\nIn order to understand this protracted process we will study the mechanics of transition through a comparative case-study approach in particularly Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain. Peripherally we also study the question of why the Arab Gulf states have been relatively immune from popular uprisings, and we incorporate in our discussion as well the role international actors (the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, the European Union) have played in the unfolding of the uprisings and beyond. &#160;D.

What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called \"nuclear peace.\" The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power. <em>Dist.

They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What's so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors. <em>Dist. SOC or INT</em>. B. L.

Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments.

From a cultural anthropological perspective, we want to understand how manga and anime texts constitute a &#8220;culture&#8221; in a distinctive way and how it relates to existing sociohistorical conditions and aesthetic traditions. We may also call this culture &#8220;otaku culture,&#8221; in so far as this is how some of its participants and observers habitually describe it today.&#160;Contemporary otaku cultural experience and sensibility touch on a wide variety of issues and ideas including nationalism, globalization, locality, technology, gender, subjectivity, postwar history, death, the human, the animal, and the inanimate. As such, the culture of anime and manga is not simply a convenient window through which to explore &#8220;Japanese culture&#8221; but is itself a heterogeneous site of cultural action, norms, desires, aesthetics, economy, and politics. <em>Dist: LIT; WCult: NW</em>.

Our basic aim is to analytically delineate the meta-pragmatic/ hegemonic stereotype of Japan as a homogeneous ethnolinguistic community and to consider critical alternatives to it. We will explore ethnographic accounts of heterogeneous sites of language-in-use, and address issues such as language standardization, globalization, gender and race relations, subcultures, affect, and political economy. <em>Dist: LIT; WCult: NW</em>. Nozawa.</p>\n<p>In 14W, <em>Everyday Life and Memory in Postwar Japan</em><em>.</em>&#160; This course examines diverse techniques of memory-making in postwar Japan. In particular, we will be interested in the personal, everyday, and affective dimensions of memory-making practices and narratives. How does history look like when viewed through the lens of everyday practices and personal desires? How should we account for the relationship between macrohistories of social groups and microhistories of personal, idiosyncratic experience? Drawing on social history, cultural anthropology, studies in autobiography, and material culture studies, we explore diverse topics such as: postwar/postcolonial politics of memory; life history writing; trauma and healing; archives, monuments, and mementos; nostalgia; funerary practices. <em>Dist:LIT; WCult:</em> <em>NW</em>.

In this course we will turn to some of the works by Latin American and Caribbean artists and writers in an attempt to illuminate and explore some of the wonders of the cultural dynamics that shape the many faces of what we call Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>\r\n</div>", "title": "History, Culture and Society: The Many Faces of Latin America", "number": "4", "subject": "LACS"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<em>Consult special listings</em>\r\n</div>", "title": "First Year Seminars in Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies", "number": "LACS 7", "subject": "LACS, LATS "}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p></p>\n<em>(Identical to History 5.6) </em>\r\n</div>", "title": "Pre-Columbian and Colonial America", "number": "10", "subject": "LACS"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p> </p>\n<p><a class=\"sc-courselink\" href=\"/en/2012/orc/Course-Descriptions-Undergraduate/LACS-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Studies/LACS-30\">LACS 30</a>.4, in 12F at 2, <em>Religion and Music in Cuba</em>.

Industrialization, bureaucratization, reification generate new patterns of human behavior, social interaction and political attitude that were often in conflict with \"traditional Brazilian values\". Literature, the arts and popular music of the period not only documented shifts in urban settings, but also captured what were the reactions to and outcomes of the \"brave new world\" of the metropolitan centers. Moreover, artistic representation generated a complex discourse on modernity, shaped by aspirations and fears, projections and objections.

Complex mental experiences are broken down into ever simpler components, which are thought to be represented in the activity of neurons tuned to those simple components. The dominant example of this way of thinking is the doctrine of the neuronal receptive field. Neurons are thought to respond to information in a small part of, say, the visual field. This conception of information processing in the brain is increasingly seen as incapable of explaining many things that the brain in fact does. There are many examples of mental activity that involve holistic processing across global patterns of sensory input all at once. Neuroscience and Psychology therefore need to reassess their reductionistic assumptions. In fact, there is a longterm tradition that criticizes reductionism within Psychology itself. These movements have been led by the Gestalt and Ecological Psychologists.

What is time? Was there a beginning to the world? If so, when did the world begin? Will it end? How will it end? Can we control time? Does anything exist beyond life and death? All cultures have struggled with these perennial questions, and we continue to do so today. Religious traditions have offered us many different answers. This course examines various understandings of time in several religious cultures: Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Daoism. We will investigate different ideas of how the world came to exist and various views of the end of time; discuss different ways of organizing time (calendars); and compare different notions of salvation by which these religious cultures, and the variants within them, tried to assuage fears of individual death or the end of the world. Using expectations for messianic redemption or visions of power, these imaginings of catastrophic \"end-of-times\" and ideas of salvation served as the basis for missionary work and conversion, as well as the impetus for rebellions, wars, and imperial programs.

The beginning of the last century witnessed an unprecedented burst of literary and artistic creativity: the late flowering of the great realist tradition coincided with the advent of modernism, a worldview defined by an insatiable hunger for novelty, will to experiment, taste for scandal and provocation, and bohemian lifestyles. The modernist schools and movements-symbolism, futurism, acmeism, imagism, and suprematism-were terminated in the 1930s by Stalin. Since then, despite decades of censorship and material hardship, Russian writers have continued to produce one of the world's greatest literatures. Readings will include Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, works by such authors as Chekhov and Pasternak, and samples from the radical avant-garde.

Women&#8217;s efforts to challenge fiercely repressive regimes, deeply entrenched norms of machismo and extreme poverty defy conventional stereotypes about women and provide us with inspiring examples of how to sustain hope during difficult times. The seminar will introduce students to recent scholarship on women&#8217;s movements in Latin America in the 20th century and seek to understand the emergence, evolution and outcomes of women&#8217;s movements in particular countries and cross-nationally. <em></em></p>\r\n</div>", "title": "Gender Politics in Latin America", "number": "31.1", "subject": "WGST"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p></p>\r\n</div>", "title": "Power to the People: Black Power, Radical Feminism and Gay Liberation", "number": "31.2", "subject": "WGST"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\tThis is a general course on women in politics.
