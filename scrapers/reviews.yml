  course_comment: cool assignments, interesting subject matter. would recommend.
  prof_comment: balkcom is probably the best CS prof. very clear lectures, very laid
    back and approachable guy.
  workload_comment: ! "Like any CS course, you gotta stay on top of the coding exercises.
    That said, for me they were sort of a breeze. I'm super comfy with python and
    with coding in general. i consistently finished the projects a few days ahead
    of time, but i also had no life that quarter.\r\n\r\nalso, no exams or even any
    sort of final. just a coding assignment every week. cool stuff."

  prof_comment: Was a little unprepared. We'd occasionally get side-tracked in class
    because we'd find an issue with one of his proofs that we'd then work through
    collectively. It was a nice exercise (one time we found a flaw in the original
    paper!) but often put us behind schedule.

  course_comment: ! 'It was great. Leearned a ton about actual OS and got to hack
    Linux and Solaris internals. Final project was patching the Linux kernel. The
    patch ended up being 6000+ lines. Great learning experience. '
  prof_comment: Sergey is an awesome prof, a little mismanaged sometimes but you learn
    a ton and build a great relationship.
  workload_comment: Workload tends to be easy except for the midterm and the final
    project which are very hands on and technical and take a few all-nighters. If
    you can manage your time well you will be in great shape. I had to crunch through
    a lot of stuff for the final project which was mostly my fault for starting a
    two month project a few days before the deadline

  course_comment: really interesting and hands on. one issue is that for the course
    to be possible everything runs in simulated environment. however, this couse really
    teaches you not to be afraid of hacking system itnernals and poking around the
    actual implementations of APIs. I think I became a more robust developer after
    it, since it is impossible to do anything itneresting without hacking internals
    :_
  prof_comment: Professor is awesome. It's Sean Smith!
  workload_comment: workload tends to get crazy for about two weeks (context switching)
    since the abstaction of the hardware can become too much to handle. You will be
    coding with major bugs for about two months until you finally understand what's
    what and how to fix them (impossible to fix those bugs until you are pretty much
    finished, really hippie experience). Great course. Pick a good partner!

  course_comment: Great course, you build the itnernet and a p2p client. I mean what
    else is there to say. You get really comfortable with sockets and threads and
    run a big code base. This is a great experiece for any developer.
  prof_comment: Campbell is probably the most fun prof in the CS department. He will
    have you do stuff that sounds just crazy and really cool. Just get it to work
    and you get an A. Campbell is one of my top profs for sure.
  workload_comment: If you start early you will be fine. I had a two other major courses
    this term and two jobs and this one was not a problem. You might want to find
    a dual screen for this since you will be ssh-ing into 8 machines or more to test
    your networiking protocols (ot you might be some crazy scrip monkey, I'm not).
    But start early! otherise you are screwed.

    there are only a few concepts though, and once you get those down everything is

  course_comment: Nice course, but moves way too slowly. Now that the major doesn't
    require *everyone* to take this class, I wonder if the pace will speed up.
  prof_comment: Explains things very clearly—nearly to the point of beating a dead
    horse. When the class is full of systems kids that need to take it for their major,
    though, I guess this is appreciated.

  course_comment: Lectures alternated between student presentations of papers (sometimes
    interesting) and campbell explaining exactly what we need to do to complete a
    lab (tiresome, unnecessary).
  prof_comment: Campbell's a bit of a mess.
  workload_comment: For the assignments, he'd give us a PDF containing a screenshot
    of 95% of the code we needed to write, and we'd spend several hours manually copying
    that code into Eclipse. Not super fun, and you didn't really have to know what
    you were doing. Average amount of work, as hours go.

  course_comment: Really interesting course - went into the number theory behind cryptography.  Good
    pace - he started each class with a refresher of what happened last class, which
    was good to keep in mind when we were building upon material that we previously
    learned and that could be confusing.
  prof_comment: ! 'The professor really cared about his students, went at a good pace,
    and '
  workload_comment: Very manageable workload.  Weekly problem sets and no tests, just
    a final project which was fun to do.  You have choice over what your topic is
    as long as it is loosely related to any topic you study and he approves it.

  course_comment: Fast-paced and really interesting.  The concepts you learn in class
    and the problem sets make you think.
  prof_comment: Very enthusiastic, eager to answer questions, and explained concepts
    clearly.
  workload_comment: Lots of work.  Weekly problem sets and short assignments (which
    aren't that short sometimes). It's necessary to really get prepared for other
    CS courses at Dartmouth, though, so its nothing to complain about.  There are
    a lot of help hours for assignments.

  course_comment: Fairly fast paced course with a lot of reading involved.  Less quantitative
    than some other econ courses, but still a lot of graphs to know.  Gives a great
    argument for free trade (he's persuaded me).  Great course, interesting subject.  I
    don't regret taking it as a 9L
  prof_comment: Really wants to make sure everyone understands the material.  Explains
    concepts clearly, and is happy to help during office hours.  Goes over a lot of
    examples and fun anecdotes in class.
  workload_comment: Lots of reading.  No problem sets, just tests, so you really need
    to make yourself stay on pace with the workload

  course_comment: Great course!  Has some interesting applications at the end.  Not
    really a proofs based course, but the professor added some in to give us a better
    understanding
  prof_comment: Cracked jokes and kept the class energetic and alive.  Explained the
    concepts well, and made the proofs clear.  Had notes printed out for everybody.  Altogether
    an amazing professor

  course_comment: ! 'Very intriguing course.  You get exposed to a lot of german authors
    who are considered the greats of german literature.  Lots of movie clips (or entire
    movies).  Very philosophical, high-level class, very enjoyable.  '
  prof_comment: Great professor.  Makes his expectations clear, encourages you to
    write about anything you want, and is a fair grader.  Allows you to resubmit work.
    Duncan is a character, you need to take a class with him!
  workload_comment: Reading Dr. Faustus took a little more time than he expected it
    to, and we had to read fast to catch up.  Otherwise, well paced and not too much
    work.  Only around 4 papers, usually around 6 pages each, with a final paper of
    10 to 12 pages.

    financial world, this course gave insight into how financial intermediaries and
    markets work.
  prof_comment: ! 'Very knowledgeable professor, teaches by the socratic method, which
    is really useful.  Does not make fun of you if you get a question wrong, just
    is interested in making sure students know the right answers.  '
  workload_comment: Pretty much a chapter and a problem set a class.  He encourages
    you to work in groups, and you definitely need to.  Meet before every class to
    go over the questions.  The exams are not that hard, and he gives you a lot of
    practice tests.

  course_comment: I wasn't particularly engaged by the course material, but I think
    that was personal preference. It was organized chronologically on the geologic
    time scale, and it matched the description well.
  prof_comment: I missed a lot of class for athletic competition, and the prof was
    super understanding and really helpful. However, he was trying out a new attendance
    policy that killed me. His lectures were awesome; super detailed, clear. I felt
    well prepared for the exams and I didn't do any of the readings.
  workload_comment: Evenly spaced assignments and quizzes, knew what to expect. Assignments
    were hands on, but not too difficult, especially if you have an aptitude for this
    kind of open ended thinking characteristic of the earth's history...

  course_comment: It wasn't really a writing course, which was fine by me... We did
    3 essays but didn't focus on writing at all. Lectures were about random stuff
    in the solar system and research the prof had done on micrometeorites. About half
    of what we learned I used in an essay.
  prof_comment: It was cool how much experience she had in research. It made me realize
    that the people here are/have been on the cutting edge. She didn't give much feedback
    for my writing style though.
  workload_comment: ! ' I didn''t think assignments were spaced well. We had periods
    where we were doing nothing followed by a 20 hour week... The first essay was
    short and relatively easy, the research paper was long, and the last paper was
    an extremely specific wiki on micrometeorites, which was super hard because there''s
    very little research available on them!'

  course_comment: I definitely felt like it served its purpose as a writing course,
    without being overwhelmingly focused on writing. We had a wide variety of assignments,
    from group projects to short casual responses to formal essays to journal entries.
    We presented a couple orally. Always had enough time for the assignments. I got
    the feeling that there was a bigger task of the class than to teach us to write.
  prof_comment: Class was always intriguing and exciting. Prof O seemed like it was
    his goal to give us a life lesson, not just a writing class. His passion for the
    themes of the book we read (things like mindfulness and self introspection) was
    perfect for me, and I liked the idea that what we were doing was just a class,
    but what we were learning could be applied to so much more. We did mindfulness
    exercises and meditations, and we even covered a bit of environmentalism.
  workload_comment: Evenly spaced, manageable. Tasks were clear, suggestions for improvement
    were helpful, option to revise was useful.

  course_comment: Rise of China by Lind - a great comprehensive look into China and
    Asian politics overall. I had no Chinese background in this class, but came out
    feeling like I could have a solid debate and good understanding of China's position
    and prospects in the world.
  prof_comment: Professor Lind is a specialist in North Korea and Japan, not China,
    so she wasn't able to give us a huge amount of extra knowledge about China outside
    of our readings, but her international relations background helped a lot to put
    China in context. Does a great job fostering class discussion.
  workload_comment: Lots of reading, which you should be able to discuss in class.
    A midterm paper and a written identify concepts/essay final. Enough to keep you
    busy, but the reading is interesting.

  course_comment: I placed out of this course but didn't feel like I understood the
    material. I am super interested in math but not very good at it, so I hoped this
    class would help me gain a deep understanding of calc. It didn't... I found lectures
    to not be helpful at all, since the group was far to big to ask one-on-one questions
    when I was confused (which was often). Office hours were extremely busy. The tutorials
    were what saved me. The grad students were so helpful. For me it was all about
    finding the right person whose mind thought about math the way mine does.
  prof_comment: ! 'It was clear she knew what she was doing, and she told a lot of
    fun analogies to help us understand, but the style of teaching was something like:
    let me tell you how to do something and why it works, and then tell you what it
    is we''re actually doing. I''d done the stuff before, taken an AP test on it,
    and couldn''t figure out what we were trying to do! I wish she''d told us our
    objective, then taught us how to do it. Also, her office hours were not helpful.
    They were so short, and always too crowded to be helpful.'
  workload_comment: Same every week; online problem sets, didn't vary much. Grading
    system was ok, seemed like I got the points I deserved, sometimes I felt like
    I did better than I deserved. You could also get a little ahead if you wanted.
    Tests were evenly spaced and I always knew what was going to be on them.

  course_comment: Interesting material, well-paced.
  prof_comment: Irwin was super nice and approachable, though sometimes he made explaining
    things more complicated than they need to be.
  workload_comment: Workload is quite easy - the only thing you need to read is his
    textbook and a few extra assigned readings, and he covers most of it in class.
    Nevertheless, the midterms/exam were tricky.

  course_comment: It was interesting and there was a lot of reading, but it was really
    easy.
  prof_comment: His lectures can be pretty dry and are exactly like the readings,
    but they were somewhat interesting and he is really laid back and tries to make
    it interesting and easy.
  workload_comment: There was a lot of reading, but not much else, the paper wasn't
    that bad and neither were either of the exams

  course_comment: This course was incredibly fast paced and also really intense. It
    was a huge amount of work with so many readings every class and you have to do
    them since it is such a small class you have to do all of the readings. The final
    project was huge and using Stata was a requirement, which was very hard to do
    since she didn't teach much about it.
  prof_comment: She knew a lot about the material. She is really nice and wants everyone
    to do well

  course_comment: Really interesting course if you are willing to put in the time.
    You cover the entire text book cover-to-cover. Most of the learning is done on
    your own. You prep questions for class, are cold called during class, and expect
    to know the answers
  prof_comment: ! "God mode. Awesome professor, really interested in the subject and
    thrilled to be teaching. He spent 20yrs on Wall St. as a chief economist - the
    guy knows his stuff. Lot of fun and very interesting to talk to. Definitely go
    ask him questions in office hours.\r\n\r\nTotally gets Dartmouth life too, son
    was a Dartmouth '09."
  workload_comment: More work than you'll do for any other Econ class. Entirely worth
    it, but it can be 3-6hrs of prep for every class.

  course_comment: The course was great because I like jazz. It was pretty much just
    sitting in class, listening to Jazz greats, and watching a few videos. If anything,
    it might've been a little slow, but it was relaxing and enjoyable. If you like
    Jazz, definitely take this course. If not, read below (workload).
  prof_comment: Haas's voice lulls you to sleep pretty easily, but since you're falling
    asleep to Jazz, it's not so bad. He's a really chill guy that knows a ton about
    Jazz music, and sometimes he bring out his sax or sits at the piano to play ridiculously
    well.
  workload_comment: The workload for this course was unbelievably easy. There is supposedly
    nightly reading, but I didn't know about them until a month into the term, and
    never had to do them. There are 2 quizzes, a midterm, and a final, which all require
    that you memorize some songs, their titles, their artists, and one or two facts
    about them, but Haas blitzes out EXACTLY the details you need to know ahead of
    time. There were only a few things not on those, and if you go to even a few classes,
    you'll pick up on the added information.

  course_comment: The pacing for the course was great. Anyone who has taken BC Calc,
    this is definitely the right course. It wasn't terribly challenging, but it kept
    me on my toes.
  prof_comment: ! "Van Erp is probably the best professor I've had at Dartmouth. He
    is a phenomenal lecturer, always making odd comments that keep it interesting,
    as well as being extremely easy to follow.\r\n\r\nHe's funny and easy to understand."
  workload_comment: ! 'The workload was perfect for the course. The weekly problem
    sets were good for reinforcing material and were never a struggle to complete
    on time. There were a balance of challenging and easy problems, and the optional
    nightly homework really is optional: if you don''t understand the material, do
    it.'

    lecturing and really willing to explain material in depth. The content is pretty
    interesting, but kind of dry at times, and the workload is not that bad. The tests
    are graded fairly, not hard but not easy

  course_comment: What can I say, it's a Professor Moor class. The man is brilliant,
    the content is really engaging, and the workload is light and graded easily. What's
    not to like?

  course_comment: Professor Duthu is one of the best professors you'll encounter at
    Dartmouth, and this is the "easiest" and least specialized class he teaches. Absolutely
    take it! The readings help on the exams, but aren't required. Be warned though,
    Duthu doesn't grade easily, but he does grade fair.

  course_comment: I'll start off by saying that I'm not going to be a humanities major,
    to give you some context. This course really dragged out. The reading (Walden
    Pond, Borderlands La Frontera, others...) was not interesting for me. The best
    part of the course was the final paper about semiotics. I wished semiotics had
    been a more significant part, if not the focus of, the class.
  prof_comment: Not a great professor. He seems bored with everything he does, he's
    a rather tough grader, and he doesn't help your writing at all. I received no
    feedback on my final paper (the only research paper, so it would have been nice
    to know how to improve, or if I even did well). He didn't help me improve my writing
    in any way.
  workload_comment: ! 'The workload wasn''t bad. There weren''t too many essays, but
    don''t put them off. The reading was spaced out fairly well too. The only issue
    was the final paper (which I''ve already said was the best part of the class).
    There was very little time to do enough research (1 week, I could''ve used 2)
    and then write a 10 page paper about it, but if you don''t mind spending 3-4 evening
    of your reading period to do a good job, go for it. '

  course_comment: This course was great. I had taken AP Phys C in high school, so
    a lot of it was review. If that's your concern, read somebody else's review. The
    demos were pretty good, and the material is well presented, at least if you have
    LaBelle. Not my top rated class, but one of the best.
  prof_comment: Professor LaBelle is a great lecturer. He has this quirky habit with
    thought questions that make you feel like you're 12 years old, but then you realize
    that they're actually tough questions, and that he's just being energetic. He
    did a great job presenting the material and was available during many office hours
    to help out if needed.
  workload_comment: The workload was pretty consistent. The online problem sets weren't
    bad, although I highly recommend the help sessions at Thayer--show up as a group
    and power through the problem sets. There were definitely some very challenging
    problems, but if you somewhat enjoy physics, this won't bother you.

  course_comment: The reading material for this course was excellent. I really enjoyed
    the books. However, the pace was irritatingly persistent. We had a read a new
    book each week (sounds manageable) but we also had to write a short essay once
    a week. It sounds not too bad, but for me it felt a little oppressive at times.
  prof_comment: Aden was a great professor. He's interesting and knows how to really
    push your writing. He doesn't always know what to do to keep a discussion going,
    or how to explain his concept of a thesis--which is normal, just difficult.
  workload_comment: I felt that the workload was pretty tough. There was a whole lot
    of writing, but if you can find a Seminar with minimal workload/writing, you're
    probably in the class everyone else wanted. If you like science fiction literature,
    take Literature of the Machine, but expect to do a lot of tough writing--6 two
    page essays and 2 longer ones--but at least it'll improve your writing abilities.

  course_comment: The course was great. I had no programming experience coming in,
    and I never felt like I had no idea what was going on, but I definitely learned
    a lot. Even if programming started out as some scary monster for you, the course
    starts out slowly enough to explain it and then you can really do a lot with what
    you know. If anything, it was almost too slow.
  prof_comment: Professor Taylor was nothing special. Some people in the class thought
    she was basically a "professional powerpoint reader", which was sometimes true.
    She wasn't a particularly engaging lecturer, but she was easy to follow and straightforward
    on material, giving excellent example programs. I've heard a lot of good things
    about Shepherd, so I was bummed not to be taking from him.
  workload_comment: The workload was no problem. I had thought that the daily Short
    Assignments were going to be irritating, but they turned out not only to be extremely
    helpful for learning the material, but also even a little fun, tinkering with
    the program until it worked. The Long Assignments can be a little more challenging
    to get done, but I've heard they were easier this year than in previous years.

  course_comment: This class is a horrible compromise. The first half was all about
    neuro, which the CS half of the students didn't care about, and I'm sure was so
    basic it was silly for the neuro people. The second half was some basic computer
    science, which didn't incorporate the bio at all—and the presence of non-CS people
    in the class meant it was incredibly hand-wavy. Overall a waste of time.
  prof_comment: Granger just cares about being quippy and making jokes. It got pretty
    obnoxious.

  course_comment: ! 'Really good course. Slightly more straightforward than P15 in
    that it was mostly just standard E&M, but still very difficult. Lectures consisted
    of Marcelo working through derivations and sample problems. Problem sets came
    from the textbook, which was phenomenal. I''ve never had a textbook that was more
    helpful and well written. Great tool to study from. Subject matter is interesting;
    applications in engineering and higher level physics are made clear. E&M is conceptually
    less intuitive than mechanics, but not much harder once you learn the fundamental
    laws. '
  prof_comment: Marcelo is AWESOME!! Definitely the best prof I had my freshmen year.
    He has a passion for his subject area that is unmatched, and loves teaching at
    every level. His lectures are clear as can be, and the best part was all of his
    tangents. We once spent 20 minutes as a class(which was only 7 people) discussing
    string theory and why he gave up on it. He talked about his research often, which
    was really interesting, because he is definitely a leader in theoretical physics.
    All in all, I never thought somebody could make me want to be a physics major
    so much! Even if it's physics 1/2, everyone should take a class with Marcelo.

  course_comment: Great, great course if you love physics. I was unsure about taking
    P15 since I only took Physics B in high school and basically just needed physics
    for the engineering prereqs, but i'm so glad i took the honors course. The problem
    sets were very engaging, especially once we got into the material that no one
    had ever seen before on relativity and quantum mechanics. They were of course
    very difficult, but the TA was great at helping you get started on any problem.  Lectures
    could be a bit dry at times, but that was mostly during the beginning of the course,
    at which point we were basically reviewing classical mechanics. Now again, it
    is a harder class than P13, and should only be taken if you took Physics C in
    high school or you are a calculus and physics ace. But totally worth the work
    if you can do it.
  prof_comment: ! 'Barrett was not the best prof I''ve had, but as you will realize,
    teaching physics can be done one way: by doing it. Lectures would consist of Barrett
    working through derivations and applications, which would frequently be mimicked
    on homeworks. He was much better at inspiring interest when we got to more advanced
    material on quantum mechanics. I can''t say that I didn''t fall asleep at times
    when he was in the middle of some lengthy derivations. '

  course_comment: Not a terribly interesting course, but the material is very logically
    paced. Prepare to review a bit of Math 11 and learn some linear algebra (if you
    didn't take 22) but it was nothing extraordinarily difficult. If you're interested
    in Diff Eq, then this course should be fine. If you need to take it for ENGS or
    something, also fine. Otherwise, probably not that great.
  prof_comment: Professor Gordon gets distracted a lot in lectures and is kind of
    a bumbling old lady, but she got the material across pretty logically. You can
    tell she finds it really interesting, although she's a little boring to sit and
    listen to. Nothing special, but there's no reason she should stop you.
  workload_comment: Daily problem sets are a bit much, but also helpful. Sometimes
    you have to spend 10-15 minutes figuring out exactly how the day's material applies
    to the homework, but it was nothing terrible to deal with.

    something to think about). Then in class Winkler would roll the die to figure
    out who would present on the homework. So the course was basically zero work,
    but the questions he posed (while easy) were fun to think about.

  course_comment: ! 'Very interesting--learned about differing government styles in
    different countries like USSR, El Salvador, South Africa. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Horowitz is a great guy. Means well and wants his students to do
    well. Most classes were mostly lecture with some discussion, he''s not the greatest
    lecturer but it''s still easy to follow. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Two blue-book midterms, 5 page paper, and blue-book final.
    Readings every night which took some time but weren''t bad. Horowitz graded fairly
    easily and definitely fairly. '

  course_comment: Pretty bland material. It covers everything in Micro, but it is
    certainly not exciting.
  prof_comment: He was a pretty boring lecturer. Just plain white slides and he talked
    the whole time. I think he may get better, but the material wasn't thrilling and
    he didn't help a lot.
  workload_comment: ! 'Just two midterms, final, and problem sets graded for completion.
    Very mathy course, overall not bad but I think non-econ majors struggled a lot. '

    the class talking about more common sports and equipment but spent most talking
    about bikes or skis. Not even interesting stuff about those skis.

  course_comment: 26 is the most interesting and useful class in economics and maybe
    at the school. You'll learn everything you need to know about stocks, bonds, mortgages,
    government treasuries, derivatives. You must take this if you want to work in
    finance.
  prof_comment: ! 'Kreicher was very fair and knowledgeable. He''s a former Wall Street
    guy, so he added his own insight and stories when needed. He''s a pretty hilarious
    guy too--I''d take this class with him if you could. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Lots and lots of work. No way around it. Read a chapter in
    a textbook before every class and answer questions. He calls on people in class
    to answer the questions, just like Kohn, so you have to be ready. It''s 20% of
    your grade. Intense workload, one midterm and one final. If you put in the work,
    you can get an A and it''s incredibly rewarding. '

    class.
  workload_comment: ! 'Very manageable. Some homework assignments, a term project

  prof_comment: Professor X was great. The TA's were some of the more awful people
    I have had the privilege of meeting in my Dartmouth career. They were incredibly
    condescending and I don't think they understood that people take this course to
    fill distributive requirements with minimum pain. Furthermore, they were rude...where
    does Dartmouth find these people?
  workload_comment: Very consistent. Problem sets/tests every couple weeks. Do the
    readings and pay attention in class and you should have no problem getting an
    A in the class.

  course_comment: Pretty interesting, but its title is a bit misleading. It's essentially
    entirely about face processing, so by the end of the term it can get a bit boring,
    as not many other aspects of social perception are discussed.
  prof_comment: Duchaine is the man, funny, great lecturer, very friendly, all-around
    awesome guy. Some of the questions on his test were kind of annoying though, picking
    out little details from article.
  workload_comment: A weekly little brief to make sure you do the readings, a midterm,
    a final, a paper, and a group presentation. None of them are too bad.

  course_comment: Very interesting, starts off a bit slow as the anatomical evolution
    of adaptations for bipedalism isn't the most interesting thing in the world, but
    then just gets more and more fascinating and fun. Lots of really cool videos are
    shown in class.
  prof_comment: Dominy is awesome, great guy, pretty funny, clear lecturer, extremely
    knowledgable about tons of things. He's a fantastic professor and has done a ton
    of cool stuff, you should really go to office hours and just chill with him.
  workload_comment: Readings weren't too bad and were pretty interesting, the only
    things that count to your grade are two midterms and a take-home final. Midterms
    weren't too bad, there were a few questions that were annoyingly just completely
    unimportant little factoids

  course_comment: Interesting, well-paced, and probably semi-applicable to the real
    business world. Case studies were pretty frequent and always very interesting
    and informative.
  prof_comment: Professor Peteraf is great, she's very nice, a very clear lecturer,
    and she tries to make class pretty entertaining.
  workload_comment: Only four one-page homework assignments (and you get to drop one)
    and three midterms (no final). The midterms are pretty straight forward and easy,
    plus you can bring in a page of notes so you don't even really need to study that
    much.

  course_comment: ! 'This was quite possibly the worst class I''ve taken at Dartmouth.
    My only regret it not dropping it sooner. The lab, lecture, and reading had nothing
    to do with one another and when it came to the test it was almost guess work.
    Office hours were almost mandatory in order to understand what was going on in
    the class. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Lipson was cool and helpful. She did lots of demos but when it
    came time for the test she expected us to know everything...literally EVERYTHING!
    Even the stuff she said wouldn''t be on the tests. '

  course_comment: ! 'Great class. It was all about writing memoirs so basically just
    writing stories about your life. If you are into creative writing at all I would
    suggest this class. '
  prof_comment: ! 'The prof is actually sort of famous. He has writing a lot of promenant
    religion papers and books. The course doesn''t focus on religion but the readings
    come back to it now and then. He was easy to talk to, understanding and interesting.
    Best of all when you went to his office he would sit and read through your paper
    line by line and help you choose words, syntax, or whatever you needed to make
    a good piece of writing. Prof also knows many of the authors that wrote the books
    for class so you get to sometimes meet them depending on the school year and skype
    etc. '
  workload_comment: The readings seem sort of intimidating (1 book per week) but its
    not at all that bad. They are all interesting and helpful books (more memoirs).
    The best thing about the writing was that you could do it over and over until
    you had something good and also if you were running late it was possible for an
    extension.

    hard the first few weeks when you don't understand anything and drill can suck
    but its a good class. Learned a lot.
  prof_comment: ! 'A really funny prof. He loves having students visit him in his
    office because he is bored and just likes to talk. He is basically just a character
    from Ratatouille that came to teach French at Dartmouth. Murphy is also a lax
    grader but doesn''t usually teach French 1. '

    others so it was easier but also it was harder going into French 2 with a weak
    writing base. '

    to get to know him and see the cool stuff he has there (Piltdown Man skull replica,
    stuffed bonobo, shark calling floats etc). He is also a freshman advisor and loves
    helping out freshman. Great guy and great prof. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Super easy. There was reading every week but its almost optional
    based on how the prof lectures. If you don''t understand something it is a good
    back up. No other work besides that. '

  course_comment: ! 'This course was meh. Not crazy interesting. Perez made the class
    feel like it was a large lecture and didn''t seem to want to have fun on the topics
    that we were doing. There was a lot of potential with studying Voodoo, Rastafarianism
    and other really interesting religions but this class basically glossed over them.
    I was expecting more and could see this class being great if it was slowed down
    and enjoyed by the prof. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Helpful and fair. The papers in the class weren''t hard at all,
    some just took more time. If you want help just biltz the prof and she''s good
    about meeting and talking with students. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Lots of reading. Usually you could skim and the next day in
    class when we went over it you would be fine. A lot of the discussion was based
    on opinion. If you didn''t want to participate in class that would be your loss
    but the prof doesn''t take off much of the grade. '

  course_comment: ! 'Good class about children''s stories. A very interesting Writing
    5 and very helpful to my writing. You get unlimited rewrites and the prof wants
    you to do well so she doesn''t mind reading over the paper multiple times. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Prof was sort of awkward and strange but she was nice and helpful.
    She knew her stuff and has worked in publishing and children''s books for years.
    She encourages you to talk with the authors and figure out if they knew what they
    were writing and how it came to them. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Lots of reading and rewrites but that is what is needed to
    make a better writer. She loved to workshop and present so it didn''t seem like
    hard work just sometimes it got boring. Looking back most of it was helpful in
    how to write a paper and I appreciated the fact that she could help everyone no
    matter what their skill level was in writing. '

  course_comment: Pretty easy distrib, sometimes class isn't that interesting but
    Osterberg is a great prof and absolutely loves what he teaches! There are 6 homeworks,
    4 quizzes and 3 tests. Osterberg sometimes pulls from the reading but if you skim,
    you'll get it

    2 midterms and a final. There are also a couple of blog post/discussions that
    are easy to do. Rose does a great job explaining concepts and applying everything
    you've learned to current economic situations. Highly recommend

    a 1 pg response paper due every week, a 7 page paper and then a 15 pg final paper.
    For homework we had reading you could skim and movies to watch. Great class!

    about the subject. Somewhat difficult grading but relatively fair I think. '
  workload_comment: ! 'Readings seem optional. A bit of memorization for the final

  course_comment: ! 'Interesting course, interesting discussions. Would be a really
    good seminar but was a HORRIBLE writing 5 course. Didnt get ANY critique or help
    on my writing style (may have actually ended up worse off). Really was looking
    forward to writing improvement but didnt get that at all. Dont take it unless
    you think you''re already a good writer! Some parts of our class discussions were
    pointless. '

  course_comment: I took this course to get a sci distrib, and ended up liking it
    so much! Dobson is great and knows how to keep his classes interesting for everyone,
    no matter what your science/anthro background is like, so I highly recommend taking
    any of his courses!
  prof_comment: His lectures are great, he's a funny guy so he keeps lectures entertaining

  course_comment: This course on curating microcinema was super interesting and fun!
    More of a project based class with no exams and just a few short response papers
    (like 2 pages each), highly recommend any of Jodie's courses!

    super young and a lot of fun!

  course_comment: NOT an easy A class. Every x-hour is technically used, although
    we were occasionally released early if watching a movie (this means typically
    three hours spent in class on Mondays - usually movie-watching time, sometimes
    lecture). Interesting in that we did not focus on classic movies but rather movies
    of various genres that I probably wouldn't have found or thought to watch on my
    own.
  prof_comment: Very difficult paper grader in the sense that what seems to be appreciated
    is direct repetition of the prompt and listing of the technical aspects of the
    film - centering papers around a theme or thesis outside of the film techniques
    not exactly appreciated...
  workload_comment: Readings important for quizzes (at least for the first half of
    the term); several papers throughout the term (occasionally with scene/shot drawings
    that take quite a bit of time) and a final paper. Most difficult paper was one
    based off of "film-events" outside of class. These films were shown at the Hop/Loew
    with the director present, and it typically wasn't possible to view them more
    than once.

  course_comment: How well you do in the course depends entirely on how much Heckman
    likes you. I practically bombed both quizzes and still got an A because I participated
    and put up with his shit.
  prof_comment: Carey Heckman...where to start? He's the most opinionated man I've
    ever met, and he also finds a way to become pretty creepy. It's kind of scary
    how much the man learns about all of his students, which would be a good thing,
    but he's constantly trying to relate and make jokes. If you're a future philosophy
    major, watch out! Also, I think he read our facebooks. Make that shit private.
  workload_comment: ! "As far as a freshman seminar goes, there was a lot of reading,
    and it was all very technical and pretty difficult to understand. It all got discussed
    in class, but it was still a struggle.\r\n\r\nThe first two papers required you
    to define computer science and determine its purpose from the readings Heckman
    gave you, which wasn't too bad. He takes the imperative to teach you to write
    very seriously, which could be good, but didn't seem too necessary with our class.
    The third paper is a research paper on an aspect of computer science, which was
    a lot more work for a freshman seminar."

  course_comment: Don't take it unless you're a ling major. It was very interesting,
    it was an easy A, and I learned a lot, but I didn't get any distribs for it, and
    the final paper was hell.
  prof_comment: Ernst is a very funny guy, and extremely enthusiastic about what he
    does. He really made the course fun
  workload_comment: Throughout the term, the only work was to do exercises in the
    textbook and to look up the etymology of words, which was fine. The first two
    essays were just busywork (rephrase the information in these chapters of these
    books), but the research paper required serious amounts of effort that I hadn't
    had to put into the class up to that point.

  course_comment: Really interesting class - HARD tests, only 3 short (15 questions)
    multiple choice tests that were trickier than expected
  prof_comment: Really really great prof - but might suggest looking at other classes
    of his to take

  workload_comment: Igoe assigns a lot of readings, but you learn quickly that you
    don't have to do them all. He gives a very detailed study guide before each test
    that literally has all of the questions that can possibly be on the test on it.
    If you put in the time and get that study guide done, you can do great even if
    you don't do all of the course work throughout the term.

  course_comment: Psyc 1 is a necessary evil, but for an introductory course it's
    not too bad.
  prof_comment: I personally liked Bucci's style of going by the book and delivering
    clear lectures. Wheatley also gave great lectures. Kelley is all over the place,
    but keeps class interesting. Kleck is good as well, but just not as engaging as
    the others in my opinion.
  workload_comment: Read the book and use the study guide.

  course_comment: The course was not bad for a statistics course.
  prof_comment: Professor Pfister goes out of his way to make sure that students understand
    the material, although he does have a tendency to go on tangents that add absolutely
    nothing to the learning experience.
  workload_comment: The workload is not terrible, but there's also no way to BS the
    course. You have to do the work and do it correctly.

  course_comment: The course itself is very useful for anyone who intends to perform
    social science research.
  prof_comment: Professor Duchaine only taught about the first third of the course.
    The quality of the TA really depends on which one is assigned to your group.
  workload_comment: The workload was on the light side, although the final project
    can take quite a bit of time.

  prof_comment: Professor Scheiner keeps class entertaining, but uses a lot of the
    class time to talk about her family or tell other stories. She brings the material
    to life, however, and does it with a sense of humor.
  workload_comment: Don't even bother reading the book. Many people didn't even go

  course_comment: Class was pretty interesting and well-paced, although it took a
    little while for me to get into it personally, as I am not really a huge fan of
    poetry at heart.
  prof_comment: McCann is a fantastic lecturer and really knows a lot about Romantic
    literature. He is also good in office hours although he can use a lot of complicated
    jargon at times. He isn't a harsh grader though and is very willing to help you
    with your papers. He definitely appreciates it when students come see him beforehand
    about papers.
  workload_comment: This class is definitely a manageable workload. You'll mostly
    be reading poems, so the reading isn't too long, (aside from Frankenstein and
    Caleb Williams). Since McCann is such a good lecturer it is definitely possible
    not to do all of the reading and still get a lot out of the class, and there are
    only 3 papers (2 short and 1 long) so not too onerous.

  prof_comment: Absolutely amazing prof.  Created the syllabus on his own, had it
    completely memorized, presented it in a Socratic manner, moved at a perfect pace,
    was super congenial and helpful outside of class, and was generally completely
    awesome.

  course_comment: ! "Really interesting course! Learned a lot!\r\n\r\nA BIG TIP FOR
    ALL WHO WANT TO TAKE THIS CLASS-- you will have a much easier time if you pick
    a preexistent dataset (i.e. contact the author of a paper to see if you can use
    their dataset) instead of picking a topic and finding the data for it."
  prof_comment: Edmonds is an incredible professor. Be prepared for some friendly
    condescension... in the best way possible. Honestly, he just wants you to prepare
    you to write a substantial paper.
  workload_comment: This class is undoubtedly a lot of work. Edmonds gives pretty
    solid deadlines/grades. Even if you screw up a few times (I sure did!), it's still
    possible to get an A!

  course_comment: Super interesting! Better when you have more people speak up in
    class. Bumpus reconciles this by having small group discussions throughout the
    class.
  prof_comment: ! 'Bumpus is hands down one of the nicest/best professors at Dartmouth! '
  workload_comment: Definitely a manageable class! If you have a hard class lined
    up, this is a great complement because it's so interesting, and she is a very
    fair grader.

    of taking the NR if all of your other classes are out of control during finals.\r\n\r\nLearned
    a lot about basic accounting."
  prof_comment: Really nice guy. Super understanding. He does a nice job with material
    which can be super dry.
  workload_comment: Definitely manageable. You can mess up the homeworks and still
    get full credit as long as you showed some effort.

  course_comment: As my first engineering course, I thought this class was extremely
    helpful in introducing me to how different systems function. This professor established
    important concepts in the beginning and continued to apply these same principles
    throughout each section. Repetitive, but necessary. The labs were sometimes unproductive
    because your results were often predicated on luck. If you didn't get good enough
    results, then you had to redo the lab.
  prof_comment: The professor distributed his hand written notes to the class before
    the lecture. He then went over them on the overhead projector. His notes are pretty
    good but you will need to go beyond them and try some more examples for yourself
    so you can better prepare for the quizzes. The textbook was essentially useless.
  workload_comment: The work load was heavy, especially for sophomore summer, but
    if you knew your stuff, the homework wasn't impossible to complete on your own.
    The MATLAB stuff could present occasional hurdles, but there were TA's to help.

  course_comment: Not that interesting. Good third class if you have a hard term.
  prof_comment: Kind of difficult/disorganized sometimes. A little too aware of the
    fact that it's a football team layup class.
  workload_comment: Sometimes I spent way too much time on those labs. That being
    said, it usually worked out, so it was probably worth it. A little difficult at
    first for those who have no programming experience... otherwise, it's a layup.

  prof_comment: People will tell you "avoid this class." You will be a national merit
    semifinaling, 4.0ing, two sport varsity captaining, freshman.  You will say "naw,
    I'm up for a challenge."  This class is not about a challenge. It feels random,
    nothing ever gets graded, and the professor, while she has good intentions, does
    not care about you.

  course_comment: I liked the class overall; it was a good overview of a very broad
    topic. We got to read bits and pieces of various Russian authors, and our textbook
    went over all of Russian history--not a huge amount of detail, but good for getting
    a sense of who the Russians are and why their culture is the way it is.
  prof_comment: Gronas is a little scatter-brained, but I think we got a good sense
    of Russian culture through his teaching style.  He is brilliant, but sometimes
    hard to follow.
  workload_comment: Workload was fine; some of the projects seemed a less than relevant
    to Russian culture (we had to create an "-ism" and have a piece of visual art,
    music, literature, etc. for our movement.)

  course_comment: I recommend it.  It took me about until this class to really be
    able to have conversations about real things in Russian, so this class was neat
    because our class discussions got pretty lively.
  prof_comment: Rakova is always pretty patient and encouraging, but she will also
    push you to do better if she thinks you can. I highly recommend taking any class
    Rakova is teaching.

  course_comment: ! 'Fascinating, fascinating course. Lectures were jam-packed with
    information, but they were highly organized so they were really easy to follow.
    If you take detailed notes you''ll do really well on the tests. I would definitely
    recommend this course for anyone interested in Germany. '
  prof_comment: Greenberg is extremely knowledgeable about the material. He's super
    nice and helpful, so definitely go to office hours or email him if you have questions.
    He's not a pushover when it comes to grading, but he's not unfair either. He's
    very strict when it comes to the policies of the class, sometimes annoyingly so;
    just make sure you follow his paper guidelines (word count especially). Overall
    a great professor- I'd def take him again.
  workload_comment: Workload was pretty manageable. During the week you read primary
    sources (usually a couple pages), and then for discussion on Fridays you have
    to read a secondary source (usually at least 100 pages), so I recommend you start
    reading the secondary source at the beginning of the week so you're not trying
    to read a dense book on Thursday night. There are wo papers, a midterm, and final.
    Pretty straightforward.

  course_comment: So, you want to be a doctor? First, take this weeder course so that
    you're entirely sure. You're going to have to compete with another hundred premeds,
    all trying to get the A. And the course is graded on a curve, so you definitely
    won't get the grade you want. What, you're interested in biology for any reason
    other than medicine? That's too bad, you'll still have to suffer through this
    course. But at least you'll learn some science, even though it won't really be
    relevant until you take specific foundation courses.
  prof_comment: Peart is a good lecturer who gets across the material about evolutionary
    biology. Jack, on the other hand, is not effective. His material is less intuitive,
    and he's very dry. Expect to find yourself dozing off on days he teaches, just
    waking up to answer clicker questions.

  course_comment: If you have to take it, take it with Maue. If you just want a foundation
    course, you should look somewhere else.
  prof_comment: Velez is very funny and an engaging lecturer, but he has difficulty
    explaining the material to the class. Several times, he taught us the wrong thing
    one day, and the next day, had to go back and apologize and try to explain it
    again. His examples are very specific and not out of the textbook, and you will
    be expected to know them.
  workload_comment: Make sure you read the text and go to class. You won't understand
    one without the other, and questions from both will be on the exams. Speaking
    of exams, all three (yes, three) midterms and the final are doozies. Velez drops
    the worst grade, but you'll still need to study your ass off to figure out his
    weird multiple choice questions

  workload_comment: SO MUCH FUCKING WORK. I've taken some tough classes here and this
    beats them all in terms of workload. The labs take 10-12 hours to do, and there
    are frequent short assignments. Plus, the exams are actually pretty hard.

  course_comment: Not very interesting. Beethoven was a horrible man in my opinion.
    His work is ehh and it's not like Haringer will make you any more in love with
    it, since he's more of a Music History guy. Don't be fooled by the no prereq designation--
    you better know how to read a score. The reading was actually pretty interesting--
    especially the articles, but sometimes we'd have two pieces to listen to and an
    article and a chapter out of a book, and it was just too much. Not an easy A with
    Haringer for sure.
  prof_comment: ! 'Avoid Haringer like the plague. He''s enthusiastic and knowledgable
    for sure. But he''s inexperienced. Usually a hard-ass with quizzes. Didn''t really
    convey a true love for the music. Gets disappointed when everyone gets a 14/15
    on a quiz, because it was too "easy." Doesn''t know how to lecture clearly. Lectures
    are in fact erratic and do not provide a clear framework, connection, etc. Not
    helpful during office hours. '
  workload_comment: Workload is a lot more than a typical music class. If you're looking
    for an easy MUS art distrib, take MUS 4 with Levin hands-down. MUS 4 will be a
    whole lot more memorable and it'll change your view of music a lot more than MUS
    10.

  course_comment: A lot of the reading is actually really dry-- you have to read excerpts
    from a coffee table book on opera-- which is not too bad, and a book with a bunch
    of firsthand documents, which can usually be hit or miss. This class though can
    change your life, especially as a musician, since basically all of classical music
    after the 1700s was influenced by operatic techniques, styles, etc. Opera in general
    is a pretty cool genre-- if you like plays, dance, fashion, theater, orchestral
    music, vocal music-- it's basically all that combined.
  prof_comment: Haringer had office hours where he would review before each quiz which
    was basically a lifesaver. Not too much a fan of his lectures-- too disorganized
    and he moves really fast.
  workload_comment: Workload was pretty overwhelming at times. Having to watch two
    acts from an opera and read 60 pages plus another 20 pages from the Somerset-Ward
    is actually not what I was expecting for a music class. Consider this a class
    on opera history with a little musical stuff thrown in here and there.

    is YOUR example on a positive externality? What is YOUR example on a tragedy of
    the commons type problem? Cold-calling gets really annoying/intimidating also.
    He doesn't lecture almost at all.
  prof_comment: Professor is smart but puts on a front by saying he worked on a textbook
    problem for an hour trying to use the chain rule or something. Sometimes it's
    hard to know whether he knows his sh*t. He doesn't have the best reputation of
    being good during office hours. He can be pretty humble though-- tries to respect
    students' opinions.

  course_comment: Ok course, gets better as term progresses. Class lectures are sometimes
    unorganized and it is hard to grasp what is actually important to understand.
    Also sucks that the class is so big. I would only recommend this class if you
    have an interest in public policy. If you do, you'll enjoy parts of the class.
    If you have no interest in public policy and are just taking it for the first
    year fellows, you probably won't enjoy it.
  prof_comment: Good professor, but not the best lecturer. No power point slides,
    just talking most of the time.  Quite knowledgeable about the subject though and
    enjoyable to talk to outside of class.
  workload_comment: ! 'Lot of reading, but you don''t really need to do all of it.
    A couple of papers that weren''t too bad and were made into somewhat interesting
    assignments like policy memos. '

  course_comment: I would highly recommend this course. Learn a lot of useful analytical
    skills. Course is relevant for everyone whether you are pre-med, interested in
    health policy, or just interested in the class, since we are all consumers of
    health care. Really changes how you think about health care and evaluate it. Best
    class I have taken at Dartmouth.
  prof_comment: Best professor I have had at Dartmouth. Very engaging lecturer. Makes
    a strong effort to make class exciting. Very knowledgeable on the subject and
    nationally recognized.  Pretty funny as well.
  workload_comment: Constant workload, but nothing too crazy. A lot of excel assignments
    early in the term and a consistent workload of supplemental videos and readings
    later in the term.

  course_comment: The course this year was different from most. We were given total
    freedom in choosing a topic for a final research paper, which was the focus of
    the entire class. It was incredibly rewarding but also completely data-driven,
    so make sure you have a detailed, reliable dataset early on in the course. Each
    day he flipped a coin to determine whether a class section got a pop quiz on that
    day's background readings. Otherwise, only two problem sets due in the first week
    and no major tests or final.
  prof_comment: Edmonds is brilliant but condescending. Do not go into office hours
    thinking you can make small talk and have him tell you all the answers. He can
    be intimidating and you need to earn his respect before he gets less scary.
  workload_comment: Almost every day had its own deadline. Do not fall behind in this
    course, and start cleaning your data early. It always takes longer than you think.
    I wrote my paper (~40 pages including tables and figures) literally in the last
    two days, and it was a lot worse than it could have been.

  course_comment: This course taught very little macroeconomics. Half of the course
    is devoted to a few half-hearted and simple lectures on growth theory and international
    trade, then the work on the major final research paper starts kicking in. There
    are no tests and he purportedly grades the problem sets (but we never got them
    back, so that claim is highly suspect). I learned a lot about my paper topic and
    wrote a great paper, but didn't get much else out of the course.

  workload_comment: This class isn't too bad, and the quizzes every other week force
    you to stay on top of your work. The real "work" is just in studying for these
    quizzes.

  course_comment: This is a great course. It's very well taught and very interesting.
    The math background required is technically the same as physics 13, but you'll
    find that taking math 11 or 13 is helpful. The pacing is a lot better than 13,
    and the concepts fit together very nicely.
  prof_comment: Professor Rogers cares a lot about your grade and about how well you
    understand the concepts. He'll make sure you do fine in the class, and he'll go
    over things again and again until you get them. That said, he's kind of a boring
    lecturer.

  course_comment: The topics covered in class are very interesting, though the classes
    themselves were a little boring. The readings are interesting, and you can write
    your essays on anything.
  prof_comment: Professor Peterson is a great professor who obviously loves what he
    does. That said, he tends to talk about certain topics for a very long time. It
    ends up feeling a little less like a seminar and a little more like a lecture.
  workload_comment: It was just three papers, all of which you can write on anything.
    It's pretty manageable and you write 2 rough drafts before the final.

  course_comment: If you want to keep learning organic chemistry or plan on doing
    research that will involve organic chemistry, then this is a great class to take.
    You learn a lot more about the structure and functionality of the groups and Gribble
    is amazing.
  prof_comment: Gribble knows everything and the handful of times he couldn't tell
    you when and where something was discovered, he references what's going on in
    the field (often in his own lab) right now. You could not ask for a better professor.
  workload_comment: There was no assigned work but keep in mind that in order to do
    well, you must constantly review the material and clarify concepts by going to
    office hours. He is extremely approachable and even more helpful, so definitely
    take advantage of this!

  course_comment: I was really interested in the material, so I found this class really
    awesome. It covered different religious traditions but also looked at the intersections
    that religion had with race, gender, ethnicities, class, politics, etc. It was
    really interesting to see how religion operated in terms of all these things in
    the region.
  prof_comment: Perez really knows all this stuff! She often knew the authors of readings
    personally, which I guess happens when you're good at your job in academia.
  workload_comment: The work is very, very manageable. My term there was a project
    that you basically designed(she had to approve it though) on a topic of your choice,
    a midterm and final based on the readings and discussions, you had to present
    the readings for a day and participation. The readings were usually about 2 or
    3 articles per day. Sometimes they got a bit long but for those you could usually
    just skim them if you don't want to finish them.

  course_comment: The course structured for an independent learner. It's seminar-style
    so it relies on presentations and discussion. The reading is not overwhelming
    and very good but to get something out of it you need to engage with it, otherwise
    you might want to take another class.
  prof_comment: Reena Goldthree is a boss. She is as good as it gets when it comes
    to a professor. She really knows the material and the field, she is understanding
    of students and our lives on campus (she was a student not too long ago) and is
    interested in seeing you develop your skills. She takes forever to return your
    essay(s) but her feedback is really, really useful. I would recommend any of her
    courses, especially to history majors for both the content but also what you will
    gain from her.
  workload_comment: ! 'The workload wasn''t light, per se, but it is totally manageable.
    As it''s a 10A, we had to read plenty for each meeting (again, enough for a lot
    of learning and good discussion, but not too much to take over your weeks). We
    only had an essay, a final research paper and the proposal for the final paper
    as far as actual work. Aside from that, you have to participate and lead a discussion. '

    Star Wars jokes and going off on weird tangents and making references to your
    college days is not going to make me interested in this course. I don''t even
    care if you make it hard, but at least show some interest in what you''re teaching!
    I had a really hard time following his lectures because he''s off telling some
    story about Kevin Bacon and I tune out and then suddenly we''re on to some super
    important concept which I halfway miss because I didn''t feel like it was my job
    to listen to his Kevin Bacon stories. It''s so scary how a prof can completely
    change how much you like learning something. '

  course_comment: The course was slow at first, but after the first essay was due
    it goes VERY fast. Lots of reading over little time and lots of writing. Great
    because there are no midterms/final (just hand in all of your essays as a final).
    It really did help with my writing.
  prof_comment: ! 'Professor Snyder was AMAZING. As well as very, very helpful and
    caring, she is smart and has many great ideas. She utilizes class time to help
    with your writing immensely. I strongly recommend her if you truly want your writing
    to improve. '
  workload_comment: The course was slow at first, but after the first essay was due
    it goes VERY fast. Lots of reading over little time and lots of writing. Professor
    Snyder is very good with making you manage your time by spacing it out. Don't
    wait till 10 PM to start the reading and/or writing!

  course_comment: ! 'This was the most straight-forward class I''ve taken at Dartmouth.  It
    was well paced.  It''s not a super interesting class, but I feel like the concepts
    are important to know about.  '
  prof_comment: Curtis was extremely helpful outside of class, graded fairly, and
    was extremely clear.  She definitely knows how to structure and organize a class.  If
    you take Econ 1, take it with her.
  workload_comment: ! 'Very manageable workload.  The problem sets are easy to do,
    and she let''s you work on them with a friend if you want.  '

  prof_comment: He was helpful, understanding, but did not care if you didn't care
    about the course as much as he does. Spent a lot of time outside class prepareing
    quizzes and labs designed to challenge every student
  workload_comment: a lot, one can't breathe---start the moment you get it and you'll

  workload_comment: seems like a lot of work, but in middle of the term one works
    on the project without having to go to class and it's chill. you better get a
    working project to do exceptionally well---it doesn't harm you that much if it
    doesn't work, but the project is 30% of the grade

    the Professor changes every year (It depends on who comes from BNU).  Prepare
    to do a lot of writing.  It felt like a repeat of Chinese 22/23, but with a different

  prof_comment: She was nice, but grading was subjective and depended a lot on how
    well you knew her.  She didn't really take your previous background into account,
    or she would hold it against you.

  course_comment: A different interesting topic in Greek and/or Roman culture or history
    every day, from public spectacle to philosophy to sexuality. A good way to get
    a sampling of classical studies. I went into this class because I thought it sounded
    mildly interesting and I needed a distrib. I came out planning to go on the 13S
    Greece FSP. This is a great class, mostly because of the professor.

  course_comment: Very interesting and generally well-paced. Sometimes, however, you
    will have to skim through hefty reading assignments during the second half of
    the course. Some say prof is biased against U.S., but the subject matter and materials
    clearly justify this. Essay prompts are very vague. If you're interested in the
    subject matter and don't mind a liberal slant, you certainly won't regret taking
    the class, despite some of these frustrations.
  prof_comment: ! 'Approachable and nice, but often vague in her essay prompts and
    ambiguous/boring in her lectures. '

  course_comment: ! 'The material was cool; if you like science you''ll like this
    class. You will probably only get through vision, hearing and a little bit of
    touch though; theres a ridiculous amount of material the prof wants to cover but
    he doesn''t get through all of it. I also like how the exams were structured -
    each was one third of your grade and they were not cumulative. '
  prof_comment: ! "Professor Hughes is really passionate about the topic and he enjoys
    it, and he makes the material much easier to handle than if it was a dry, boring
    professor. He has a tendency to go off on tangents - I didn't really like his
    lecture style but I know people who do. He also really tries to be available -
    he had exam review sessions before the first two midterms and welcomed people
    during office hours(although he does have the tendency to cancel them at a moment's
    notice). He also has study guides for the exams which are REALLY helpful! Study
    with these and you'll do well. \r\nDownsides: he'll try to scare you away in the
    beginning because he teaches the material very intensively and doesn't believe
    in making things easy for students (I think several people dropped out after the
    first midterm) ; also, he's not very helpful if you're floundering. He tries if
    you make the effort to go to office hours but he's just too knowledgeable about
    the topic, I think, to understand what it feels like to be struggling with the
    basics.\r\nOkay professor, overall."

  course_comment: ! 'This course is a requirement for the major - I wish they could
    make it more interesting though. The way Norris did it, the first half is lectures
    where a lot of the material is review of Psyc 10 and Psyc 1 stuff. Then there
    is data collection for the experiment you''ll be conducting(which took WAY too
    long) and the last section, which is compressed into 1 and a half weeks, is  analyzing
    your results, presenting them, and writing your paper - all of which amounts to
    roughly 50% of your grade. Though it''s a lab credit which actually doesn''t involve
    extra hours, I wish data collection had been done in a ''lab'' section like other
    classes have, because that would have given me WAY more time for my poster presentation
    and paper. '
  prof_comment: Professor Norris is really nice and easy to talk to. She's really
    helpful with setting up the experiment - although I wish our group members' suggestions
    had been taken into account more. It kind of felt like the prof and the TA completely
    took over structuring our experiment. Also, most of your work is overseen by the
    TA so you don't see Prof Norris much. Your grade also depends on your TA.
  workload_comment: The workload for this class was pretty easy. In the beginning
    it's not much, although later it kind of punches you in the face, when the paper
    and the presentation come up. The last week or so really interfered with my other
    classes because I'd gotten used to that level of work from Psyc 11.

  course_comment: I really liked this course, the material was pretty easy and it
    was structured well - nothing really counted for a huge part of your grade though,
    so you have to make sure to keep up with every single thing the prof assigns.
    But if you bomb a couple of things also, it doesn't really matter. I liked the
    work for this class, it was actually pretty fun.
  prof_comment: Professor Millspaugh is really nice but he's also new to Dartmouth
    so he had trouble keeping up with things - we got a lot of our grades very late.
    I didn't really know how I was doing in this class until the end. He wasn't very
    clear about our performance in the midterm evaluation either.

    of little things you have to keep track of. But it's easy.

  course_comment: I definitely recommend taking a public speaking course.  You'll
    need it no matter what you do.  There are numerous speeches paced out throughout
    the course that definitely help you improve as a speaker simply because you keep
    giving speeches.  All the assignments are manageable, and if you do your work,
    you'll get an easy A/A-.  That being said, avoid Anguiano if you can.
  prof_comment: Take this course with Compton instead!!  Anguiano is a poor speaker
    and often seemed nervous and unsure of herself.  She had little to no part in
    improving my public speaking, so if you're looking for a professor who really
    knows this stuff, go for someone else.
  workload_comment: ! 'The work is very manageable, and it''s easy to do well if you

  course_comment: What's crucial to know is that this course is very classics-heavy,
    and they mean classics as in Greek and Roman literature, the ancients. Everything
    ties back to them (Iliad, Plato, etc.) so if you're only interested in literature
    in general and not necessarily classics, this may not be the course for you. That
    said, I was not particularly enamored with the greco-roman classics either, but
    I don't regret reading anything in this course. It really all boils down to what
    professor you are assigned for discussion section. Some, like Chaudhuri, are not
    as great at facilitating discussion between the students themselves (rather than
    with just him), but others I've heard have great discussions, so it all depends.
    You will, however, be guaranteed a group of peers in the class who really care
    about doing well and that rubs off - apathy is something that doesn't carry well
    in a class like Humanities 1/2.
  prof_comment: Professor Chaudhuri loves to tear apart papers. He admitted it himself.
    It took a couple times, but I think eventually most people in our discussion section
    were hardened to his criticism. In person, during office hours, he's markedly
    different, much... nicer, and he's usually fair in his grading - his expectations
    are very high and A's are scarce, but he'll reward improvement when he sees it.
  workload_comment: It's a lot of reading, and getting ahead on weekends and such
    is definitely advisable. Also, they give out pop quizzes on the lectures, so make
    sure to study those before every discussion section, especially key words like
    Greek terms, names of writers and works of art mentioned in lecture, etc. The
    papers are pretty spaced out though, so there is plenty of time to go to RWIT
    and talk it through with them once or twice or even thrice.

  course_comment: Interesting period of history (1865-1945)! The mix between lectures
    (x2 per week) and discussions (x1 per week, and Monday so you had the weekend
    for reading) was good. It was cool that the class didn't focus strictly on international
    relations in the traditional sense, and the prof did a good job of putting developments
    going on in the US in a more global context (e.g. post-civil conflict militarization
    and industrialization in the late 1880s in the US as well as Germany and Japan)
  prof_comment: Professor Miller was very knowledgeable, particularly in terms of
    US-Japan history. Very organized. Expectations were usually fairly clear, although
    less so for written assignments, but she was available during office hours for
    any questions. Lectures could seem a little fast-paced, and she usually just had
    pictures and maps, with occasional quotes, on the accompanying powerpoints.
  workload_comment: Lots of reading. Could be I'm a freshman so I just didn't know
    what to expect, but even so some weeks were much heavier than others. Also, strict
    and challenging max word counts on all writing assignments, but I think I've definitely
    become a better academic writer thanks to this class.

  course_comment: Fast-paced! It was my first term at Dartmouth with the whole 10-weeks
    thing to get used to, but still, the amount of material covered is super impressive
    for language learning. But the class is GREAT -- usually very small, and the prof
    is always directly engaging you and your classmates (often via conversation with
    you) every minute of the class. It's fun and very low-key in class (lots of silly
    sentences result). Almost all of the material is initially self-taught via homework
    that usually just tells you to look at the textbook (it'll be pretty obvious in
    your small class the next day if you didn't do it)--and the textbook is free and
    online. The major drawback to the class is that the only drill section is 7:45am.
    Yikes. But in my class at least we went to breakfast together afterward in the
    time between drill and class, which was fun. Oh, did I mention that after the
    first day you don't speak English in the classroom anymore? (Don't worry--somehow
    it all works out.)
  prof_comment: Ishida-sensei can seem a little intimidating at first, but she really
    wants you to succeed! And she's excellent in the classroom. The one thing is,
    if you want to ask her questions in ENGLISH, you have to go to office hours (or
    you can ask your drill instructor). She is very generous grading most work (quizzes
    can sometimes be harsh if it's fill-in-the-blank and there can't be partial credit,
    but if there is a partial credit opportunity, she has been known to take off one-tenth
    of a point for a mistake, just to give you an idea).
  workload_comment: Because class is 5 days per week, there's a LOT of time invested
    in nightly homework (most of which isn't turned in, but it is immediately and
    painfully obvious if you didn't do it, and it'll be a nightmare catching up for
    the next quiz or test since they happen on a pretty regular basis). That said,
    if you keep up every night or almost every night, there's not going to be a single
    day when you're crushed by the workload from this course--it's pretty well spaced
    out and constant (with new material every two days), so even though I spent the
    most time outside of class on Japanese versus my other two courses, it wasn't
    the direct cause of any near-sleepless nights.

  course_comment: This section was about Shakespeare in film adaptations. Really interesting
    for me as someone interested but not super knowledgeable about film. We watched
    several movies, which is why the 2A time slot was necessary (though I'd have preferred
    a 10A, but oh well). Writing about a film is a little different than writing about
    a book, so that was a challenge but in a good way. Improved my writing skills!
  prof_comment: Prof was very willing to work with students (extra one-on-one meetings,
    adjusting deadlines, giving very helpful feedback, etc.). As we were the first
    class for this topic/prof, there were a few small issues with the class that are
    likely to change because the prof was interested in getting student feedback and
    even changed aspects of the course as we went along in response to feedback.
  workload_comment: Workload very manageable. It definitely came in bursts but the
    prof, as I said, was interested in working with the students to make the workload
    more manageable while still getting everything done. No busy work whatsoever,
    and a lot of collaborative non-writing work happened in class which was helpful
    in reducing (or at least refining the focus of) the work outside of class (revision,
    essay structuring, working on theses, etc.)

  course_comment: Course material was interesting.
  prof_comment: ! 'Professor Jack can get dry at times. Most of lecture is spent going
    point by point over powerpoints available online. '
  workload_comment: ! 'The optional textbook is truly optional. Make sure you know
    how to apply the material from lectures. '

  course_comment: TAKE THIS CLASS. extremely informative, the material is a little
    challenging but manageable.  requires a decent time commitment, but the class
    is enjoyable
  prof_comment: ! 'Shepherd records his lectures and posts on blackboard, which is
    extremely helpful for reviewing material or if you miss class once in a while.  The
    textbook is not necessary; handouts are very comprehensive and Shepherd really
    knows his material well. '
  workload_comment: Long assignments were very interesting.  TA sessions helped.  short
    assignments helped a lot with learning/reviewing material

  course_comment: ! 'This was a horrible class. The pace is incredibly fast- you cover
    three topics a day and have no time at all to actually learn or appreciate the
    material. The exams are really hard and the homework is nothing like what''s done
    in class. Your only grades are the three exams and homework. This was the worst
    class I''ve ever taken. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Professor Lahr is awful. While he definitely cares about his students,
    he is a terrible professor. First of all, he is mostly paralyzed, and thus cannot
    write on the board. He instead attempts to use one hand to annotate the notes
    of other professors. His lectures are incredibly boring and he is not funny at
    all. His office hours are good, but he doesn''t help. He is rude and refuses to
    go over the exams once they are returned. Sometimes, he doesn''t even show up
    to his office hours. If, for some reason, you choose to take this class, DO NOT
    TAKE IT WITH LAHR. '
  workload_comment: ! 'A whole year of calculus in 10 weeks. The pace is SO fast.
    If you start struggling, you''re done. The homework is so hard and doesn''t reenforce
    what was done in class. The best thing ever though, is the TA sessions. Every
    night before the HW is due, the TAs have sessions where they help. That''s the
    only reason I didn''t fail. The median was a B- in this class; everyone I know
    hated it. Don''t take it. Trust me. '

  course_comment: ! 'Very boring class. Professor Jack is extremely boring and makes
    the material dull. The class is enormous (almost 200) and filled with cut-throat
    premeds who all think they''re going to cure cancer one day. They spend the entire
    class correcting the professor and asking "non-quesitons" to showcase their intelligence
    to the world. It seems like you learn nothing, though the quizzes are extremely
    hard. If you don''t have to, don''t take this class. '
  prof_comment: ! 'Professor Jack was extremely boring. It seemed like he didn''t
    know the material. Anytime people asked questions, his answer was always "I don''t
    know." His powerpoints were good, though he is a terrible presenter. Office hours
    are helpful. His quizzes are very hard. '
  workload_comment: ! 'There is no work in this class besides studying. There is a
    quiz every other week. Besides that, there is a reading book which is interesting.
    Besides that, there is no homework. Still, this was not a good class. '

  course_comment: The course itself is pretty good, but it can be a bit boring at
    times. I enjoyed it because I could actually use what I learn and apply it to
    everyday news articles.
  prof_comment: ! 'His exams were pretty straightforward, but at the same the medians
    were not too high. He definitley tries to make it interesting, but he''s still
    finding his stride as a teacher. I liked him, but he did read off his slides.
    So the great thing during reviewing was that everything you needed to know was
    on the slides, but it wasn''t always the most engaging. '
