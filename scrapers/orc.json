From a cultural anthropological perspective, we want to understand how manga and anime texts constitute a &#8220;culture&#8221; in a distinctive way and how it relates to existing sociohistorical conditions and aesthetic traditions. We may also call this culture &#8220;otaku culture,&#8221; in so far as this is how some of its participants and observers habitually describe it today.&#160;Contemporary otaku cultural experience and sensibility touch on a wide variety of issues and ideas including nationalism, globalization, locality, technology, gender, subjectivity, postwar history, death, the human, the animal, and the inanimate. As such, the culture of anime and manga is not simply a convenient window through which to explore &#8220;Japanese culture&#8221; but is itself a heterogeneous site of cultural action, norms, desires, aesthetics, economy, and politics. <em>Dist: LIT; WCult: NW</em>.

In particular, we will be interested in the personal, everyday, and affective dimensions of memory-making practices and narratives. What does history look like when viewed through the lens of everyday practices and personal desires? How should we account for the relationship between macrohistories of social groups and microhistories of personal, idiosyncratic experience? Drawing on social history, cultural anthropology, studies in autobiography, and material culture studies, we explore diverse topics such as: postwar/postcolonial politics of memory; life history writing; trauma and healing; archives, monuments, and mementos; nostalgia; funerary practices. <em>Dist: LIT; WCult:</em> <em>NW</em>.

Our basic aim is to analytically delineate the meta-pragmatic/ hegemonic stereotype of Japan as a homogeneous ethnolinguistic community and to consider critical alternatives to it. We will explore ethnographic accounts of heterogeneous sites of language-in-use, and address issues such as language standardization, globalization, gender and race relations, subcultures, affect, and political economy.&#160;<em>Dist: LIT; WCult: NW</em>.

In this course, particular attention is paid to the material cultural achievements of the richest and artistically most influential of these poleis, the city of Athens, when that city developed the western world's first democracy, built the Parthenon, and played host to the schools established by Plato and Aristotle.

Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult. Site analysis will stress the need for an imperial idiom, the accommodation of urban masses and the promotion of a sense of a shared cultural experience.

During this time Greeks confronted a series of demographic, political, social, and economic challenges and generated an array of responses that fundamentally changed the ways in which they lived, worked, and interacted. Much of what we now see as distinctive about Greek culture&#8212;democracy, stone temples, and nude athletics, to name but a few&#8212;first came into being between the mid-eighth and the early fifth centuries BCE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This course focuses on Sparta and Corinth, two city-states that, despite their geographic proximity, followed notably different developmental trajectories during the Archaic period. Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth&#8217;s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and the exploitation of its location for commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the almost rural character of their urban center, whereas Corinthians notoriously enjoyed luxuries of all kinds, were pioneers in the development of the Greeks&#8217; earliest large-scale stone temples, and converted their urban nucleus and its associated ports into the Archaic Greek mainland&#8217;s principal trade hub. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during a period that has been aptly described as an &#8220;age of experiment&#8221;.</p>\n<p></p>\nCareful study of the development of Sparta and Corinth during the Archaic period requires making thorough use of methodologies taken from two different fields: archaeology and history. In simple terms, archaeology explores the past on the basis of material remains such as pottery and architecture, whereas history conducts its investigation of bygone eras by relying principally on written texts. This course draws heavily on both archaeological and historical methodologies. There is an ample collection of relevant material; Corinth and Sparta have both been the object of long-lasting programs of excavation that began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, respectively, and both cities attracted considerable attention from ancient Greek authors.<br>\n<p>The faculty members teaching this course, one an archaeologist and the other an historian, will make a consistent effort to familiarize you with how we might go about using material remains and texts to explore the development of Sparta and Corinth during the Archaic period. We will consider the different narratives that can be constructed by way of material remains on the one hand and texts on the other, as well as how those narratives may complement or alternatively contradict each other.</p>\n<p></p>\nThere are no pre-requisites for this course, nor do prospective students require any previous familiarity with the ancient Mediterranean world.\r\n</div>", "title": "Early Corinth and Sparta: A Comparative Approach to the History and Archaeology of Two Major Greek City-States", "number": "5", "subject": "COCO"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\n <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>\n  <o:AllowPNG/>\n </o:OfficeDocumentSettings>\n</xml><![endif]-->\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">What is autism?

How have Europeans colonizers represented differences between themselves and the peoples they have conquered?&#160; How do perceived or imagined differences of ethnicity or gender arise from and help constitute the colonizers' own sense of cultural and national identity?&#160; We will explore these questions in literature and travel writings by authors such as:&#160;B&#226;, Babel, C&#233;saire, Conrad, Equiano, Euripides, Friel, Rhys, Rider Haggard, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy.&#160; Kopper.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;In 14S, <em>Exile and Writing.</em>&#160; In this course we will read classic and contemporary authors from Europe, the United States, Latin America, Africa, and the Caribbean in order to study how they have reacted to the experience of exile in their poetry, short stories, novels, memoirs, letters, and journals. While this experience stands to a large degree for loss of culture, language and home, it has also mobilized productive forces.&#160; Exilic writings thus attest as much to what is gained (Salman Rushdie) as to what is lost in translation (Eva Hoffman). Our course will study the resilience of the political exile, the adventurousness of the voluntary expatriate, the adaptability of the &#233;migr&#233;, and the restlessness of the nomad.&#160; <em>Dist:&#160; LIT or INT; WCult:W.</em> Gem&#252;nden.</p>\r\n<p>In 14X, <em>Robbers, Pirates, Terrorists: Forms of Individual Resistance in Literature and Film</em>.&#160;Robin Hood, the archetypal, courteous and swashbuckling outlaw of the medieval era, has become an English folk hero. He robbed the rich to provide for the poor and fight against injustice and tyranny. From Robin Hood via actual and legendary robbers, pirates, and corsair in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, to present day pirates, terrorists and guerilla groups in Somalia, Latin America, Italy, Germany, and the U.S., individuals have always been involved in what they considered legitimate (though illegal) resistance against poverty, authority, patriarchy, feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism. Their rebellion (or criminal action?) evokes a question that has already been at the center of Aeschylus&#8217; <em>Orestes</em>: what legitimizes individual justice versus socially controlled jurisdiction; what distinguishes vigilantism from politics, or antinomianism from legalism? Starting from the political and philosophical dichotomy between legitimacy and legality&#8212;what is ethically or religiously legitimate isn&#8217;t necessarily legal, and vice versa&#8212;this course will focus on representations of rebels and outlaws in different cultural contexts, historical periods, and cultural genres such as novels, movies, dramas, diaries, and operas. <em>Dist: LIT; WCult: W.</em>&#160;Milich.</p>\r\n<p>In 15W, <em>Male Friendship from Aristotle to Almodovar</em>.

Traditionally, war has been constructed as powerfully gendered binary in which battle is posed as a nearly sacred and exclusively male domain through which young men are initiated into the masculine gender and the male bond. From the west's great classical war narrative of The Iliad onward, the feminine has, by contrast, been defined as that which instigates male-male conflict and that which wars are fought either to save or protect, be it a war to rescue Helen of Troy, to avenge the raped women of Kuwait whose plight was invoked as a cause for the l991 Gulf War, one to protect the faithful (or faithless and betraying) wife at home, or a war to defend the ultimate national repository of the feminine ideal to be protected from the rapacious invasions of the enemy: America the Beautiful, mother land and virgin land. As a counterpart to the protection of the feminine imagined as belonging to one's own males, the narrative either tacitly or overtly allows a soldier to view the all \"enemy\" women as objects to be raped; and in the most recent wars of ethnic genocide of the 1990s onward, women in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan have become no longer just incidental victims or \"collateral damage,\" but the primary objects of enemy destruction. Starting with the Gulf War, however, the strict spatialization of the American war myth was at least challenged by the new presence of women on the war front, women as POWs, and in the present war in Iraq, women coming home maimed and in body bags; and women have now been integrated&#8212;whether successfully or not-- into all of the U. S. military accredited academies. With a special although not exclusive concentration on U.S. culture of the past century, this course will take a look at film, fiction, non fiction and biography, news media and online material, in tracing the strongly gendered myths and narratives that are wrapped up in the cultural understanding of War. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><em>Dist: LIT: WCult: W</em>.

For some, the genre provides an imaginative space for avenging the offenses of colonization.

While most critics applaud these decolonizing efforts, we will examine their darker implications as well: do these narratives do real cultural work, or do they simply cash in on a thrill-seeking, stereotype-infested, pop-cultural industry? Do such works reveal that colonial violence will beget only more-and bloodier-violence? And in the end, who are its true victims? </p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><em>Dist: LIT; WCult: Cl.</em> Course Group III, CA tags National Traditions and Countertraditions, Multicultural and Colonial/Postcolonial Studies, Cultural Studies and Popular Culture.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">Benson Taylor </p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">\n</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">\n</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\">\n</p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><strong>53.02 - In 14W at 12, <em>Toni Morrison</em> (formerly 67.11)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><em>(Identical to <a class=\"sc-courselink\" href=\"/en/2013/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-African-and-African-American-Studies/AAAS-26\">AAAS 26</a>)</em><br>\nThis course is an intensive study of Toni Morrison's major fictional works.

The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice around the country. The Black Arts Movement had far-reaching implications for the way artists and writers think about&#160;race, history, authorship, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. We'll explore these issues in work by Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others who forged the traditionally-defined Black Arts Movement in Harlem. We'll also trace the movement's flowering around country, where local political struggles and artistic traditions in Chicago, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit shaped distinctive regional variations of the Black Arts Movement. We'll consider how the literature of the Black Arts Movement intersected with other cultural currents of the time, its critics, and the persistence of its themes in contemporary culture. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><em>Dist: LIT; WCult: W</em>.

It reflects the broad variety of historical, political, social and cultural experiences that Jews from very different places and backgrounds brought to the United States. The course introduces students to the central topics, motives and literary strategies from the beginnings of a tangible Jewish American literature in the late nineteenth century to the present. The course is divided into four parts: &#160;1. The Great Tide (1880-1920) discerns the literary repercussions of Jewish immigration such as language (Yiddish, Hebrew, English), religion (Judaism, secularism), and politics (Zionism, democracy) in the writings of authors such as Antin, Cahan, Kallen, Lazarus, Leeser, Mayer Wise, and Yezierska. &#160;2. From Margin to Mainstream (1920-1945), covers the cataclysmic interwar years, which evoked an intensive production of the literary and literal children of immigrants coming of age and becoming an aesthetic and political force in debates about American modernism, among them Gertrude Stein and Henry Roth. 3. In the Years of Achievement and Ambivalence (1945-1970), the defining line of Jewish American writing altered dramatically. Jewish American literature's \"ethnic stamp\" marks and complicates the characters and perspectives created by Bellow, Ginsberg, Mailer, Malamud, Olsen, Paley, Singer and others with respect to debates about the Holocaust, the counterculture, or the civil rights, women's, and student movement. &#160;4. Wandering and Return (1970 to the Present) will focus on the broad variety of modern and postmodern Jewish American writing. Questions of contemporary ethnic identity in a multicultural society as well as attempts to reconfigure historical perspectives on the Holocaust, the Rosenberg Case, or McCarthyism inform the writings of Doctorow, Lelchuk, Ozick, Philip Roth and others.&#160; </p>\n<p class=\"sc-BodyText\"><em>Dist: LIT.

Texts include Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Lafferiere's How to Make Love to a Negro, and additional writings by Irish, Indian, and Australian authors. Our study will be organized around the questions of the production of hegemonic and subaltern masculinities, the representation of the colonial and postcolonial male body, the militarization of masculinity, and the relation between masculinity and nationalism.

African-American writers Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany offer helpful counter-texts to the history of medical experimentation on people of color in the U.S. and the homophobia of AIDS discourse in the 1980s. In essence, we look to the speculative fiction by people of color as examples of what Hopkinson has termed \"postcolonial science fiction,\" which re-imagines science and technology in the service of transnational networks rather than Empire. </p>\r\n<p><em>Dist: LIT; WCult: CI. </em>Course Group III.

on soils; in fact, soils provide nutrients to all ecosystems.  Agriculture and land management has increased soil erosion around the world, potentially influencing the history and fate of civilizations. In the modern era, this use is not sustainable; the physical and chemical degradation of soils far outpaces soil production.  This course will explore the nature and properties of souls and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource.  We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties.  The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems.  The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\r\n</div>", "title": "The Soil Resource", "number": "79", "subject": "ENVS"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p>This course may be offered any term and the content varied according to the interests of the instructor.

This will be an intensive creative writing seminar and workshop in creative nonfiction, focusing on memory as source and landscape as setting. Students will explore the notion of place, not only as a physical construct but as an idea. The work of Helene Cixous, George Orwell, Brenda Ueland, and John Berger will serve as texts. The form of the essay will be discussed through the writings of Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Anne Carson, Sherman Alexie, and others.

First, ecosystem responses to emerging environmental issues (climate change, resource development) will be introduced from a scientific perspective. In the second part, we will explore how this science is framed in policy documents such as reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The course will emphasize the importance of science communication in the policy process and will culminate with a collaborative case study that integrates climate change, resource development, and social issues.&#160; Culler/Virginia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In 14W at 12, <em>Computational Toolbox for Environmental Sustainability</em>.&#160;\n</p>\n<p>Fields related to ecology and the sustainable management of natural systems increasingly employ computational modeling. As the impetus to understand how our society can function more sustainably becomes more pressing, and the ability to gather data on natural and human systems explodes, basic scientific knowledge must be translated into actionable insights. The intersection of computing and the social and ecological sciences is an exciting growth area for researchers, students considering interdisciplinary graduate study, and future green-consultants. This course aims to provide an accessible introduction to some basic techniques useful in understanding a range of contemporary environmental issues in natural resource management (forestry, fisheries), conservation, biodiversity, invasive species, and including topics around the design of efficient systems (public transportation, greener energy/infrastructure, water resources etc).</p>\nSpencer.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\r\n</div>", "title": "Seminar in Environmental Studies", "number": "80", "subject": "ENVS"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p>This course is designed to train students to conduct research in the area of human-environment interactions.

This course focuses on building understandings of qualitative research methods and methodologies employed by geographers to produce knowledge about social relations, human perceptions, and human-environment interactions.

Considerable research over the past several decades has shown that anthropogenic disturbance has significantly modified natural processes frequently leading to degraded conditions. The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are \"natural\" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.</p>\r\n</div>", "title": "Wilderness, Culture and Environmental Conservation", "number": "12", "subject": "GEOG"}, {"description": "<div class=\"desc\">\r\n\t<p>The growth and spatial distribution of human population is becoming one of the most important global security issues.

The course will begin with an overview of geopolitical discourses that underpinned the processes of Western imperialism and colonialism such as \"civilization\" and \"social darwinism.\" It will then examine contemporary geopolitical (dis)orders through the lens of topics such as globalization, gender, environmental security, humanitarian aid, and terrorism.

Since the end of WWII, a complex system of international laws and institutions has developed that aims to regulate the human rights practices of states. In this course we will study the politics of the human rights regime and consider the following big questions: What exactly are human rights?

We begin by studying periods of Chinese strength and decline, and by learning the history of China's relations with its neighbors and with the United States. We examine China's recent transition from a position of weakness into one of growing wealth and power. Next, we explore China's relations and disputes with its neighbors, focusing on Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia. We then turn to the issue of U.S.-China relations, and examine the potential for the growth of Chinese power to lead to superpower confrontation. This course has two primary goals: (1) to familiarize students with the international strategic issues &#8211; in East Asia and in U.S.-China relations &#8211; that are salient to China's rise; and (2) to provide students with analytic tools (theories and military analysis) useful to the study of security relations in East Asia.

What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called \"nuclear peace.\" The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power. <em>Dist.

However, research has shown that activity in early sensory cortex is not fixed but changes with experience, and does not hold raw sensory data but often representations modulated by top-down influences, such as attention and interpretation. In this course, we will consider how the functional organization of the human brain changes with experience. We will also explore the variety of higher-level information that can be found at early stages of processing. A mid-term exam and a seminar paper will be required.

A specific progression of exercises will be presented to facilitate freeing the body of tensions, discovering the natural breath, releasing vibrations of sound from the body, and opening the channel for sound (throat, jaw, tongue). Resonance, vocal freedom, and articulation will also be explored. Techniques for accessing emotional and psychological truth will be practiced as fundamental to the actor's creative process. A groundwork will be laid for physical and vocal presence. Each student will be responsible for the development and practice of a vocal warm-up. A variety of speaking assignments will be made to develop confidence, presence and emotional expressivity. Text materials utilized will emerge from self-scripted autobiographical storytelling. A strong commitment to the work is necessary to explore what it means to find one's voice. Do not pre-register for this course: registration is invalid without permission from the instructor.

Traditionally, war has been constructed as powerfully gendered binary in which battle is posed as a nearly sacred and exclusively male domain through which young men are initiated into the masculine gender and the male bond. From the west's great classical war narrative of The Iliad onward, the feminine has, by contrast, been defined as that which instigates male-male conflict and that which wars are fought either to save or protect, be it a war to rescue Helen of Troy, to avenge the raped women of Kuwait whose plight was invoked as a cause for the l991 Gulf War, one to protect the faithful (or faithless and betraying) wife at home, or a war to defend the ultimate national repository of the feminine ideal to be protected from the rapacious invasions of the enemy: America the Beautiful, mother land and virgin land. As a counterpart to the protection of the feminine imagined as belonging to one's own males, the narrative either tacitly or overtly allows a soldier to view the all \"enemy\" women as objects to be raped; and in the most recent wars of ethnic genocide of the 1990s onward, women in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan have become no longer just incidental victims or \"collateral damage,\" but the primary objects of enemy destruction.
