From bestiary collections to theological tracts, from scholastic debates between birds to trickster heroes such as Reynard the fox, medieval literature is full of meaningful animals. This course will examine the significance of a variety of medieval “animal” texts, ranging from The Book of Beasts and the Physiologus to Marie de France’s Fables and Chaucer’s The Nun’s Priest’s Tale.

Using principles of both animation and editing, this course will explore the results of combination in cut and paste cinema in conjunction with the history of collage--from classic uses in painting, photomontage, architecture, and literature to contemporary functions via mash-ups, samples, and digital manipulation. Through producing projects, screening films, discussing readings, and writing papers, we will explore the varying formulations of new meanings via the pairing of found elements.\n\nIn 11W at 3A (Section 2), Independent American Film. This course examines the emergence and growth of the American Independent film movement from post-WW II to the present day. Working outside of and sometimes subversively within the Hollywood studio system, independents crafted films of an extraordinary variety across a wide spectrum of genres and styles. Despite a production and distribution system designed to exclude them, they prevailed in creating a compelling alternative vision to Hollywood’s increasingly homogenized mass entertainment. The course seeks to analyze and contextualize what it means to be an independent filmmaker, what an independent film actually is and why it matters. Students will be involved in the actual process of independent film through meeting visiting independent filmmakers and by conceptualizing, producing and budgeting an independent film of their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Handmade Strategies. This course will explore non-conventional, artisanal modes of experiments and avant-garde cinema that focus on the materiality of moving image media formats. By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries. We will also analyze how Hollywood cinema itself creates images and values that drive migration. Gemunden, Spitta.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Jews and Hollywood.

This class will look at the history of the Hollywood studio film production system, concentrating on its formation in the late teens and twenties through its greatest crises in the 1950s, and concluding with its survival as a system for television production and distribution for independent film companies from the 1950s to the present. The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump.

This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV. The class will study in depth many of Velazquez’s key works and examine how he challenged previous notions about the nature of representation, and simultaneously sought to demonstrate the “nobility” of painting.\n\nIn 11W, “The Villa Life”: Andrea Palladio and His Architectural Legacy. Historians routinely identify Andrea Palladio, the 16th-century Italian architect, as architecture’s most celebrated designer. For one who never left Italy and whose reputation depends on a small number of built works and the repeated publication and translation of a single book, such abiding esteem is an astonishing achievement. In this course, we will study Palladio’s splendid Veneto villas and his influential Four Books of Architecture in search of the reasons for his great prominence.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 10A, Books as Art: Renaissance and Baroque Illustrated Books at Dartmouth. This class examines rare illustrated books in the rich collection in Dartmouth’s Rauner Library. We will focus on the necessity or effectiveness of book illustration, the relation between text and image, book illustrations as works of art and as conveyors of knowledge. Students will study first-hand rare atlases, natural histories, medical books, minuscule prayer books, and illustrated volumes of Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Ovid. We will also take up the subject of bibliophiles and bibliomania.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 2, Abstract Expressionism. Abstract Expressionism, the first American artistic movement to gain international recognition, embodied many conflicts and paradoxes. Steeping themselves in earlier European modernism, the artists nonetheless pursued a style that was to be a-historical in its immediacy. They aimed to address the most profound questions of civilization solely through acts of spontaneity. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Pollock, Gorky, DeKooning, Rothko, and others amidst the complexities of American culture of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 11F, Mexican Muralism (identical to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies 48). This survey course introduces students to Mexican muralism.  Students will learn about the fresco technique and how to visually analyze a mural.  We will consider the following themes: cultural nationalism; art and class politics; the legacy of muralism in the US; the ethics of aesthetic indigenism; and the gender politics of public art. Student projects will concentrate of Jose Clemente Orozco’s mural at Dartmouth College. \n\nIn 12S, The Blue Rider Group. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) was an international group of expressionists whose work was centered in Munich, around 1912. The class will study the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc, August Macke, and Paul Klee; the group’s exhibitions; and the wide-ranging theoretical statements they published in fin-de-siècle, pre-war Munich. ","year":"2011","Professors":["Kristina Kleutghen"],"wc":"","CRN":"32145","note":"","dist":[],"enroll":"14"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11322","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"11W: 10 12W: 10","avg_median":3.33,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10","lab":"No","_rev":"13-f381f4b39d6eac8dabaeb469df46ab06","title":"Sacred Art&Arch of Japan","_id":"11322","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"063","Department":"ARTH"}],"description":"This course examines Shinto and Buddhist architectural, sculptural, painting and print traditions from the prehistoric to the modern era.

Cultural theorists whose work will be discussed include Ernest Renan, Benedict Anderson, Homi Bhabha, Partha Chatterjee, Franz Fanon, and Frederic Jameson, among others.","year":"2011","Professors":["Bed Giri"],"wc":"NW","CRN":"31969","note":"","dist":["LIT"],"enroll":"11"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"30803","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"16","offered":"10F: 10A, 2A 11W: 11 11S: 11, 10A, 2A","avg_median":3.609230769230768,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10A","lab":"No","_rev":"34-93bcef2d81b38f794afacc35550bb3d3","title":"African Literatures","_id":"30803","nro":"true","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"051","Department":"AAAS"},{"Section":"05","Number":"067","Department":"ENGL"}],"description":"In 10F at 10A (section 1), Contemporary American Poetry. This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2). We define and transform ourselves through stories. In this community-based learning course, students will alternate studying narratives of prison, addiction, and recovery in the traditional classroom with travel to Valley Vista, a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Bradford, Vermont, where they will participate in a program for women patients whose goal is the creation and performance of an original production that will facilitate the patients’ voices. Written work for the course will combine critical analysis and self-reflection.\n\nIn 11W at 11 (section 3), Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native Literature and Film (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 32).\n\nIn 11S at 11 (section 4), Woolfenstein (Identical to WGST 53). In her well known passage from A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf stated that “we think back through our mothers if we are women”; twenty years later, Gertrude Stein would obliquely refer to herself as “the mother of us all.” These two women occupy a central place in European and American modernism, their work having influenced successive generations of writers. Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory. Suggested background courses are English 15, Comparative Literature 72, WGST 16.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 5), African Literatures: Masterpieces of Literature From Africa (Identical to African and African American Studies 51 and Comparative Literature 51. Described under Comparative Literature 51).\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 9), Faulkner. In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. Readings include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and other.\n\nSeminars are designed as small courses, limited to twelve students, primarily seniors; qualified juniors may enroll. These courses emphasize discussion, and allow the student to develop his or her thinking about a subject throughout the term. Though assignments vary according to the nature of the material being studied, seminars usually involve class presentations and a term paper. They fulfill the “Culminating Experience” requirement. Prerequisite: at least four completed major courses, of which one must be in the same course group as the seminar.

Between genre and the Hollywood film? This course will consider genre as both an aesthetic concept and an economic one, producing stabilization and variation in product. The roles of repetition and variation, stability and change. Genres may include the western, the crime movie, the women’s film, the musical, family melodrama, the film noir or other genre-related topics such as film and literature. May be repeated for credit with a different topic.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (Section 1), Musicals. This course examines the Hollywood musical from its beginnings in 1927 to the present. Topics include the integration of singing and dancing into narrative; the musical as social commentary; musical biographies; the use of different kinds of popular music (Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, rock, country); the death and revival of the genre from Moulin Rouge to  Sweeney Todd).\n\nIn 11W at 10A (Section 2) Men to Boys: Masculinities in Film (Identical to, and described under, WGST 56.8).\n\nIn 11X at 10A, Ethnographic Film (Identical to Anthropology 12.1). Ethnographic film crosses the boundaries of academic anthropology and popular media. This course will address the construction of meaning in ethnographic films in relation to the parallel concerns of anthropology. We will consider approaches to film style, the relation of visual media to ethnographic representation, and the challenges visual forms pose to written ethnographies. The class will appeal to anthropology and film students as well as students interested in the politics of cross-cultural representation.\n\nIn 11F at 3A, Animation History. This course is an introduction to the history and development of the field of animation from the prehistory of cinema to the present day. Surveying both commercial and artisanal forms of production and distribution, the class will repeatedly contextualize the various functions of animation under a series of cultural, economic, and formal lenses. Students should bring an enthusiastic interest in the medium and devote serious effort to reading about, viewing, researching, and discussing the works.\n\nIn 12S at 11 (Section 1) Film as Poetry: The Avant Garde (Identical to, and described under, COLT 62).\n\nIn 12S at 2A (Section 2) Visual Music. This course is an introduction to the history of the exploration of the relationship between music and (mostly) abstract imagery. We will investigate this subject from its predecessors to the current day—tracing the constantly expanding practices of visual music through painting, cinema, performance, and installation—from intuitive sketch films to complex algorithmic works. Students should bring an enthusiastic interest in the medium and devote serious effort to reading about, viewing, researching, and discussing all things visual music.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jeffrey Ruoff"],"wc":"NW","CRN":"60305","note":"","dist":["INT","SOC"],"enroll":"30"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"90390","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"10F, 11W, 11S, 11F, 12W, 12S: 9","avg_median":3.816363636363637,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"9L","lab":"No","_rev":"24-201699d71ef82ad8dc5d38ff5ad792e8","title":"Introductory French I","_id":"90390","nro":"false","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"001","Department":"FREN"}],"description":"An introduction to French as a spoken and written language.

Topics include toleration, constitutionalism, rights, individualism, and slavery. Readings are drawn mainly from primary sources, including Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Hamilton, Jackson, Calhoun, Taylor, Anthony, Thoreau, and Lincoln.\n\nIn 10F and 11F at 10, Ethics and Public Policy (Identical to Public Policy 42). This course examines the nature and validity of arguments about vexing moral issues in public policy.  Students examine a number of basic moral controversies in public life, focusing on different frameworks for thinking about justice and he ends of politics.  The primary aim of the course is to provide each student with an opportunity to develop his/her ability to think in sophisticated ways about morally difficult policy issues.  Amount the questions students address will be the following:  Are policies that permit torture justifiable under any circumstances?  Do people have basic moral claims to unequal economic holdings and rewards, or should economic distribution be patterned for the sake of social justice?  Should people be permitted to move freely between countries?   Is abortion wrong, in theory or in practice, and in what ways should it be restricted?\n\nIn 11W at 10A and 11X at 2A, Immigration, Asylum and Politics. This course examines the topic of immigration and asylum from a political, social, legal and public policy perspective. As a nation of immigrants, much of our self-identity is bound up in the idea that we are forever the “unfinished” nation. What does this mean? How are our views and policies on immigration different from those of other nations with different identities and histories? How do we address the problems of security and the need (both in law and philosophy) to provide a safe haven to those who seek asylum from persecution elsewhere?\n\nIn 11S at 2A, Democratic Theory. Can we defend the value of democracy against serious and thoughtful criticism? Using a combination of classic and contemporary texts, this course encourages students to think rigorously about one of their most basic political values. It examines the origins of democratic theory in ancient Athenian political practice and the normative and practical criticisms of more contemporary thinkers. What makes politics “democratic?” What features distinguish the democratic regime from other regimes? What is democracy supposed to reflect or achieve? And what kinds of concerns about democracy did ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle raise? How (and why) did early modern and Enlightenment thinkers relocate the grounds for preferring democracy to other regimes? Dist; TMV, WCult: W.\n\nIn 11S at 2A and 12S at 10A, Ethics, Everyday Life and Law. What is the right thing to do? What is the best way of life? How, if at all, should the answers to these questions bear on politics and law? Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier—or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the “pursuit of happiness” as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens? These questions will be investigated through readings that move between the history of moral and political thought (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill) and cases and questions drawn from contemporary life.\n\nIn 11F at 12, Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty (Identical to Native American Studies 36). This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples’ experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice. Not open to first-year students without permission of instructor.\n\nIn 11F at 2, Liberalism and Its Critics. Liberal political theory is renowned for its emphasis on rights, freedoms, and limited government; but critics of liberalism hold that the liberal legacy in free societies is one of misguided energies and broken promises. Students in this course chart the development of liberal thought from the Seventeenth Century to the present, with a view to considering the central values and commitments liberals may share, and examining important contemporary work in liberal theory. The course integrates weighty challenges to the moral and political viability of liberalism, from communitarian, conservative, libertarian, and postmodern critics. Government 6 recommended.\n\nIn 11F at 2A, Theorizing Free Speech. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution reads in part: “Congress shall make no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...or the right of the people to peacefully assemble.” This course examines the philosophical and constitutional issues regarding the First Amendment’s speech, press, and association clauses.

Sound and music are integral parts of all cultures and are critical to human and animal communications. The production, transmission, and perception of sound is woven through with mathematics. With the goal of expanding both scientific and artistic horizons, we explore vibration, resonance, waves, musical instruments, the human ear, speech, architectural acoustics, harmony and dissonance, tuning systems, and musical composition. Hands-on project work may include time-frequency analysis, sound synthesis, inventing and building a new instrument.\n\nPrerequisite: high-school physics.

The aim of The World According to Mathematics is to provide the means to see everyday aspects of the world around us through mathematical eyes.

Intended for students whose major interests are outside mathematics and the sciences, the course assumes that students have only a background in high school mathematics. By considering specific examples, we will learn to express a substantial number of our experiences in the language of mathematics.

Capitalism in the last five centuries generated great wealth and prosperity in Western societies. In the last few decades, capitalism assumed a global character affecting social and economic life of the vast majority of the people in the world. Yet, capitalism has also been plagued by economic decline and failures, causing massive human suffering.

For the Portuguese explorers, the 16th Century was a time of encounters with radical otherness. Their travels confronted them with physical and cultural realities that challenged every cultural assumption, every category of the real. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the first task of the discoverer was to organize a new vision, processing a flood of color, sound and light that threatened to overcome his resistance and impose a new autonomous system of perception and representation. His second task would be to come to grips with that radical otherness. Comparisons and contrasts would provide the first basic tool for “understanding” the Other and his world. They would also set the stage for legitimate appropriation of an ‘Other” that would be found lacing and inferior in the comparative process of apprehension. In mapping out the main processes that shape the colonial dynamics of seeing, knowing and appropriating during that period we will turn to the texts of Pero Vaz de Caminha, Pero de Magalhães Gândavo, Gabriel Soares de Sousa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jose del Pino"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"31154","dist":[],"enroll":"9"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11593","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"16","offered":"Consult special listings","avg_median":3.594,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"11","lab":"No","_rev":"19-01f145846bc20f23cdf9eacf12ac1bb9","title":"Theater for Social Change","_id":"11593","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"007","Department":"THEA"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Mara Sabinson"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"11593","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"16"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"91502","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"15","offered":"10F: 10 11W: 12, 2A 11S: 10, 11 12S: 2","avg_median":3.8874999999999993,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"11","lab":"No","_rev":"32-0c76949de9d08324264f533157f5fa84","title":"Performing Migrations","_id":"91502","nro":"false","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"02","Number":"010","Department":"THEA"}],"description":"In 10F at 10 Human Rights and Performance (Identical to Comparative Literature 34).

The CBR curriculum offers a unique combination of direct involvement in ongoing clinical research studies with a comprehensive didactic program and experience conducting and designing clinical studies. Designated as Academic Associates, the students will spend time in the DHMC Emergency Department (E.D.) playing an integral role in patient identification, enrollment, and data collection for the ongoing clinical research studies.

This course examines the emergence and growth of the American Independent film movement from post-WW II to the present day. Working outside of and sometimes subversively within the Hollywood studio system, independents crafted films of an extraordinary variety across a wide spectrum of genres and styles. Despite a production and distribution system designed to exclude them, they prevailed in creating a compelling alternative vision to Hollywood’s increasingly homogenized mass entertainment. The course seeks to analyze and contextualize what it means to be an independent filmmaker, what an independent film actually is and why it matters. Students will be involved in the actual process of independent film through meeting visiting independent filmmakers and by conceptualizing, producing and budgeting an independent film of their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Handmade Strategies.

By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences.

The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump.

Diego Velasquez, sometimes called the prince of painters, was Spain’s preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV. The class will study in depth many of Velazquez’s key works and examine how he challenged previous notions about the nature of representation, and simultaneously sought to demonstrate the “nobility” of painting.\n\nIn 11W, “The Villa Life”: Andrea Palladio and His Architectural Legacy. Historians routinely identify Andrea Palladio, the 16th-century Italian architect, as architecture’s most celebrated designer. For one who never left Italy and whose reputation depends on a small number of built works and the repeated publication and translation of a single book, such abiding esteem is an astonishing achievement. In this course, we will study Palladio’s splendid Veneto villas and his influential Four Books of Architecture in search of the reasons for his great prominence.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 10A, Books as Art: Renaissance and Baroque Illustrated Books at Dartmouth. This class examines rare illustrated books in the rich collection in Dartmouth’s Rauner Library. We will focus on the necessity or effectiveness of book illustration, the relation between text and image, book illustrations as works of art and as conveyors of knowledge. Students will study first-hand rare atlases, natural histories, medical books, minuscule prayer books, and illustrated volumes of Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Ovid. We will also take up the subject of bibliophiles and bibliomania.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 2, Abstract Expressionism. Abstract Expressionism, the first American artistic movement to gain international recognition, embodied many conflicts and paradoxes. Steeping themselves in earlier European modernism, the artists nonetheless pursued a style that was to be a-historical in its immediacy. They aimed to address the most profound questions of civilization solely through acts of spontaneity. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Pollock, Gorky, DeKooning, Rothko, and others amidst the complexities of American culture of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 11F, Mexican Muralism (identical to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies 48). This survey course introduces students to Mexican muralism.  Students will learn about the fresco technique and how to visually analyze a mural.  We will consider the following themes: cultural nationalism; art and class politics; the legacy of muralism in the US; the ethics of aesthetic indigenism; and the gender politics of public art. Student projects will concentrate of Jose Clemente Orozco’s mural at Dartmouth College. \n\nIn 12S, The Blue Rider Group. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) was an international group of expressionists whose work was centered in Munich, around 1912.

This course examines the book as a material and cultural object. We’ll consider various practical and theoretical models for understanding the book form and investigating the materials, technologies, institutions, and practices of its production, dissemination, and reception. We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also spend time talking about the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience in the Book Arts workshop setting type.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 3), Evidence of Things Not Seen: Advanced Creative Nonfiction. Through close readings of creative nonfiction, we’ll investigate craft—character, voice, structure, and sequence—as well as parable, myth, and allusion, the intangible “facts” at the heart of the genre. We’ll conduct our inquiry through excursions into faith, doubt, and the territory in between. Our goal is to learn how to inhabit the ideas and experience of “belief,” broadly defined, an essential step in writing nonfiction stories that transcend their journalistic foundations.\n\nIn 11W at 2 (section 4), The Poetics of Literary Practice. Designed for students interested in the intersections of literary study, theory, and the practice of creative writing, this course explores how modern and contemporary poets have thought about their own art. How do underlying theories about language, art, culture, and history inform a poet’s literary practice? Students will develop their own creative and critical writing practices, participate in workshop critique, compose responses to the selected readings, and complete an essay that explores their own poetics.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (section 5), Some Elements of Drama. Traversing ten plays and a range of critical responses to theater and performance, the course entertains questions concerning the purpose of theater, the fascination and anxiety it occasions, and the complex dynamics among players, playgoers and playtexts, exploring what drama does for—and to—audiences. A playlist including Sophocles and Shakespeare, but also Beckett, Pirandello, Pinter and Churchill, challenges and expands upon issues raised by theorists from Plato’s time to the present.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 6), Writers at Work. This course will explore how cultural stories shape the identities of writers and inform their work. We will read writers on their writing process, looking at how their contexts inform and shape their stories. We will read and discuss such writers as: Toni Morrison, J.D. Salinger, T. Olsen, W. Faulkner, and T.T. Williams. The overarching goal of the course will be to help students to develop a concrete writing process, gaining voice and self-consciousness within their own cultural stories. Students will be encouraged to write not only about other writers’ writing process but about their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 7), The Poem in Context. A noted American writer allegedly boasted, “I don’t read books; I write them.” This course is for another kind of writer, the kind who ponders questions such as: what happens in a poem? why do some move us so intensely that we learn them by heart? how do they change the way we think? As we write and read 20th century poems, we will reflect on the assumptions that shape them and will examine their historical and social contexts. As we write and read theory and criticism, we will try to make the practical and theoretical aspects of the art cohere.","year":"2011","Professors":["Alexandra Halasz"],"wc":"W","CRN":"11436","note":"","dist":["LIT"],"enroll":"13"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11671","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"30","offered":"11W: 10, 10A, 12, 2, 2A 11S: 10A","avg_median":3.801666666666666,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"21-7aab5ceaeef7c628574229af97fa3a36","title":"Evidence of Things Not Seen","_id":"11671","nro":"true","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"03","Number":"060","Department":"ENGL"}],"description":"In 11W at 10 (section 1), Native American Oral Traditional Literature (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 34).\n\nIn 11W at 12 (section 2), History of the Book (Identical to Comparative Literature 40).

We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also spend time talking about the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience in the Book Arts workshop setting type.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 3), Evidence of Things Not Seen: Advanced Creative Nonfiction. Through close readings of creative nonfiction, we’ll investigate craft—character, voice, structure, and sequence—as well as parable, myth, and allusion, the intangible “facts” at the heart of the genre. We’ll conduct our inquiry through excursions into faith, doubt, and the territory in between. Our goal is to learn how to inhabit the ideas and experience of “belief,” broadly defined, an essential step in writing nonfiction stories that transcend their journalistic foundations.\n\nIn 11W at 2 (section 4), The Poetics of Literary Practice. Designed for students interested in the intersections of literary study, theory, and the practice of creative writing, this course explores how modern and contemporary poets have thought about their own art. How do underlying theories about language, art, culture, and history inform a poet’s literary practice? Students will develop their own creative and critical writing practices, participate in workshop critique, compose responses to the selected readings, and complete an essay that explores their own poetics.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (section 5), Some Elements of Drama. Traversing ten plays and a range of critical responses to theater and performance, the course entertains questions concerning the purpose of theater, the fascination and anxiety it occasions, and the complex dynamics among players, playgoers and playtexts, exploring what drama does for—and to—audiences. A playlist including Sophocles and Shakespeare, but also Beckett, Pirandello, Pinter and Churchill, challenges and expands upon issues raised by theorists from Plato’s time to the present.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 6), Writers at Work. This course will explore how cultural stories shape the identities of writers and inform their work. We will read writers on their writing process, looking at how their contexts inform and shape their stories. We will read and discuss such writers as: Toni Morrison, J.D. Salinger, T. Olsen, W. Faulkner, and T.T. Williams. The overarching goal of the course will be to help students to develop a concrete writing process, gaining voice and self-consciousness within their own cultural stories. Students will be encouraged to write not only about other writers’ writing process but about their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 7), The Poem in Context. A noted American writer allegedly boasted, “I don’t read books; I write them.” This course is for another kind of writer, the kind who ponders questions such as: what happens in a poem? why do some move us so intensely that we learn them by heart? how do they change the way we think? As we write and read 20th century poems, we will reflect on the assumptions that shape them and will examine their historical and social contexts. As we write and read theory and criticism, we will try to make the practical and theoretical aspects of the art cohere.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jeffrey Sharlet"],"wc":"","CRN":"11671","note":"","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"12"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11669","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"10F: 10A, 2A 11W: 11 11S: 11, 10A, 2A","avg_median":3.609230769230768,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"11","lab":"No","_rev":"26-c196ff6aaa0c119a8d4c74b28d965697","title":"Indian Killers:Murder&Mystery","_id":"11669","nro":"true","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"03","Number":"067","Department":"ENGL"}],"description":"In 10F at 10A (section 1), Contemporary American Poetry. This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2).

Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory.

In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation.

Love, sex, and sexuality have generated a wide range of literary works. This course will consider a number of genres (poems, tales, tragedies, novels, memoirs, letters, films) from the sixteenth through the twenty-first centuries in order to answer several questions. How is love related to sex? Are sex and sexuality the same thing? Do desire and love have anything in common? Why are sex and love so important in literature?

Reading can also introduce a degree of play into the landscape of desire and enable us to call into question the established order of things. The course studies the ways in which plays, essays, poetry and short stories can be interpreted and stimulate our desire.

We will read travel narratives, correspondence, novels, theatre, and poetry by writers such as Bernier, La Fontaine, Lafayette, Racine, and Voltaire.\n\nIn 11X, Family Ties. Families shape us and our sense of life’s possibilities, even, or especially, when we strike out on our own. This course examines how French writers across the centuries have depicted their and their characters’ ties to family. Readings may include works by Corneille, Molière, Lafayette, Balzac, Hugo, Ernaux, Pagnol, and Sijie.","year":"2011","Professors":["J Kathleen Wine"],"wc":"W","CRN":"60159","note":"","dist":["LIT"],"enroll":"10"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11575","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"16","offered":"Consult special listings","avg_median":3.5775,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"12","lab":"No","_rev":"15-c29b36f257ee6974aac549c16f61c4d3","title":"Sustainability in Global World","_id":"11575","nro":"true","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"007","Department":"GEOG"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Coleen Fox"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"11575","dist":["SOC"],"enroll":"16"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11328","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"11W: 2","avg_median":3.66,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2","lab":"No","_rev":"10-24c734451f3b4055b28a829ee3ed869a","title":"Geographies of Latin Am","_id":"11328","nro":"true","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"043","Department":"GEOG"}],"description":"This course provides a survey of Latin America geography from pre-colonial times through to the present, encompassing the region’s physical features, diverse cultural histories, the economic and political powers that have shaped and re-shaped its national boundaries, and the current influence of global processes on society and the environment.

This course will introduce students to the study of elections and voting behavior.  Topics to be covered include partisanship in the electorate, voter turnout, nomination rules and procedures, campaign organization and strategy, and the effects of campaigns on voters.  Although we will focus on the United States, throughout the course comparisons will be made with other industrialized democracies in order to better understand the peculiar features of elections in the U.S.  The course will also provide a non-technical introduction to some of the methods used by political scientists to study public opinion, elections and voting behavior.  Because of the timing of the course, special attention will be paid to the results of the 2004 presidential and congressional elections and the outlook for the 2006 midterm elections.\n\nIn 12W at 10A, The Federal Budget. This course will investigate the U.S. federal budget. Students will come to understand the history of, contemporary practices in and future trajectory of U.S. expenditure and revenue generating policies. The course will also cover the process by which policymakers pass an annual budget including what is supposed to happen and what actually happens in pursuit of a budget compromise. Substantial course time will be spent considering possible reforms that can be made to the federal budget.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Law and Politics of the Environment. Although most Americans believe that environmental protection should be a policy priority, environmental regulation is routinely criticized for delivering only modest benefits at an exorbitant cost.  This course provides an overview of the development and current state of environmental law and policy in the United States, with special attention to the recurring technical and political challenges that frustrate policymakers’ attempts to solve environmental problems. Huber.\n\nIn 11W at 2A. The Presidency and the Public in American Politics. This is a course on the interaction between the president and the public. We will explore different theories about when and why the president might seek to alter policy in response to public attitudes as compared to when the president will seek to change public opinion. We will analyze the various techniques and strategies presidents use to understand public opinion in the current era, and the strategies they use to affect public views. We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms?

Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.","year":"2011","Professors":["Brian Greenhill"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"11708","dist":[],"enroll":"37"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11210","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 10, 10A 11W: 10A 11S: 2A 11X: 10A 11F: 10, 12, 2, 2A 12S: 10A","avg_median":3.429,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10A","lab":"No","_rev":"25-b9baeee67311f2a70bc9a5adf3922ba4","title":"Immigration, Asylum & Politics","_id":"11210","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"060","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in Political Theory or Public Law not treated in the established curriculum.

Topics include toleration, constitutionalism, rights, individualism, and slavery. Readings are drawn mainly from primary sources, including Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Hamilton, Jackson, Calhoun, Taylor, Anthony, Thoreau, and Lincoln.\n\nIn 10F and 11F at 10, Ethics and Public Policy (Identical to Public Policy 42). This course examines the nature and validity of arguments about vexing moral issues in public policy.  Students examine a number of basic moral controversies in public life, focusing on different frameworks for thinking about justice and he ends of politics.  The primary aim of the course is to provide each student with an opportunity to develop his/her ability to think in sophisticated ways about morally difficult policy issues.  Amount the questions students address will be the following:  Are policies that permit torture justifiable under any circumstances?  Do people have basic moral claims to unequal economic holdings and rewards, or should economic distribution be patterned for the sake of social justice?  Should people be permitted to move freely between countries?   Is abortion wrong, in theory or in practice, and in what ways should it be restricted?\n\nIn 11W at 10A and 11X at 2A, Immigration, Asylum and Politics. This course examines the topic of immigration and asylum from a political, social, legal and public policy perspective. As a nation of immigrants, much of our self-identity is bound up in the idea that we are forever the “unfinished” nation. What does this mean? How are our views and policies on immigration different from those of other nations with different identities and histories? How do we address the problems of security and the need (both in law and philosophy) to provide a safe haven to those who seek asylum from persecution elsewhere?\n\nIn 11S at 2A, Democratic Theory. Can we defend the value of democracy against serious and thoughtful criticism? Using a combination of classic and contemporary texts, this course encourages students to think rigorously about one of their most basic political values. It examines the origins of democratic theory in ancient Athenian political practice and the normative and practical criticisms of more contemporary thinkers. What makes politics “democratic?” What features distinguish the democratic regime from other regimes? What is democracy supposed to reflect or achieve? And what kinds of concerns about democracy did ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle raise? How (and why) did early modern and Enlightenment thinkers relocate the grounds for preferring democracy to other regimes? Dist; TMV, WCult: W.\n\nIn 11S at 2A and 12S at 10A, Ethics, Everyday Life and Law. What is the right thing to do? What is the best way of life? How, if at all, should the answers to these questions bear on politics and law? Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier—or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the “pursuit of happiness” as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens? These questions will be investigated through readings that move between the history of moral and political thought (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill) and cases and questions drawn from contemporary life.\n\nIn 11F at 12, Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty (Identical to Native American Studies 36). This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples’ experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice. Not open to first-year students without permission of instructor.\n\nIn 11F at 2, Liberalism and Its Critics. Liberal political theory is renowned for its emphasis on rights, freedoms, and limited government; but critics of liberalism hold that the liberal legacy in free societies is one of misguided energies and broken promises. Students in this course chart the development of liberal thought from the Seventeenth Century to the present, with a view to considering the central values and commitments liberals may share, and examining important contemporary work in liberal theory. The course integrates weighty challenges to the moral and political viability of liberalism, from communitarian, conservative, libertarian, and postmodern critics. Government 6 recommended.\n\nIn 11F at 2A, Theorizing Free Speech. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution reads in part: “Congress shall make no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...or the right of the people to peacefully assemble.” This course examines the philosophical and constitutional issues regarding the First Amendment’s speech, press, and association clauses. Readings draw from Supreme Court cases and secondary sources. Areas covered include: philosophical foundations of free speech, compelled speech, defamation, hate speech, expressive discrimination, obscenity and pornography.

Understanding the nature of self-what it is and what it does-has challenged scholars for many centuries. Although most people intuitively understand what is meant by the term self, definitions have tended toward the philosophical and metaphysical. Efforts at creating more formal definitions have largely been unsuccessful, as many features of self are empirically murky, difficult to identify and assess using objective methods. Yet the phenomenological experience of self is highly familiar to everyone. So, at issue is not whether the self exists, but how best to study it. This course will survey contemporary approaches to understanding the self, with a strong emphasis on approaches from social psychology. We will consider self’s development, its cognitive and affective components, motives related to it, and how it is regulated. We will consider its functional basis, examining both its adaptive and maladaptive consequences. We will also examine its neurological basis, including case studies of people with disorders of self.

As the amount of DNA and protein sequence data continues to grow, the use and understanding of these computational tools is becoming increasingly important. Deriving biological understanding from sequence data requires sophisticated computer analyses while demanding from molecular biologists the ability to interpret intelligently the results from these analyses. Not only can these programs provide the biologist with information about his or her sequence of interest, but a solid understanding of these tools can also be used to make predictions of biological phenomena that can be tested in the lab. This course will explore computational molecular biology through both lectures and hands-on computer experimentation through homework assignments.\n\nThis course will discuss approaches to analyzing protein and DNA sequences and will foster an understanding of how to extract biologically relevant information from the numerous databases containing all this information. Topics will include basic computer architecture and operating systems, database design and searching, sequence comparisons, pattern discovery, genome comparisons, gene discovery, determining evolutionary relationships, RNA and protein structure predictions, data mining, and DNA array analysis.

Moreover, during the last three decades, detective fiction has witnessed its own “boom” and authors in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba and Mexico have adapted the grittier, hardboiled model to denounce dictatorship, violence and social injustice in their respective countries. After briefly surveying the origins of the detective story and its ideological underpinnings, the class will study short stories and novels in each of three regions (Argentina, Cuba and Mexico), contextualizing these works within their historica context.

Whether it’s at a rally for health care reform or flipping through images in a magazine, we are 24-hour recipients of messages trying to persuade us to do, buy, act, and believe. Those who use these tools of persuasion wield enormous power, power that must be used responsibly. But what are the ethical bounds of argument? If the end goal is “just,” does it really matter if evidence is “adjusted”in the process of persuasion? Does it matter if a “fact” is wrong, if the ultimate point is true? Can there sometime be a “Truth” that belies all evidence? How does one argue for or against such “Truths?”\n\nThe course is designed for students planning for a career in leadership, government, public policy, or any field in which persuading others is vital to success. The course uses the law’s Federal Rules of Evidence as a grounding document from which we will try to tease out the elements of effective argument, as well as one community’s collective “Ethic of Argument.” Other course materials draw from ethics, literature, history, popular culture, comparative law, courtroom trials, politics, and public policy.

The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change.

In so doing, we will draw on evolutionary principles such as adaptation, convergent and parallel evolution and evolutionary constraints. The course will primarily consist of lecture and readings with examination of specimens and opportunities for off-campus field trips. Offered in alternate years.\n\nPrerequisites: Biology 15 or 16.

By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries. We will also analyze how Hollywood cinema itself creates images and values that drive migration. Gemunden, Spitta.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Jews and Hollywood. (Identical to, and described under, Jewish Studies 22.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 1), History of the Hollywood Studio System. This class will look at the history of the Hollywood studio film production system, concentrating on its formation in the late teens and twenties through its greatest crises in the 1950s, and concluding with its survival as a system for television production and distribution for independent film companies from the 1950s to the present. The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump. In addition to screenings, readings, and papers, students will edit short films on Final Cut Pro software.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jodie Mack"],"wc":"","CRN":"91713","note":"","dist":["ART"],"enroll":""}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"30014","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"","avg_median":"","type":"Dartmouth","period":"9","lab":"No","_rev":"12-82d2c6bcb939e614a01c0a92c9ce079a","title":"Readings Latin Prose&Poetry","_id":"30014","nro":"true","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"010","Department":"LAT"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Timothy Peter J Perry"],"wc":"W","CRN":"30014","note":"","dist":["LIT"],"enroll":"6"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"30064","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"11S: 10 12S: Arrange","avg_median":3.165,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10","lab":"No","_rev":"12-009fec2f39b2025e532da90cfff4483a","title":"Graph Theory","_id":"30064","nro":"true","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"038","Department":"MATH"}],"description":"The theory of graphs has roots in both practical and recreational mathematics.

We will read novels by Naguib Mahfouz, Assia Djebar, Tahar ben Jelloun, Nawal El Saadawi, Leila Ahmed, Fatima Mernissi, Leila Abouzeid, and Mariama Bâ.\n\nIn 11S, US Afro-Latino Literature and Contemporary Thought (Identical to International Studies 17, Latino Studies 43, and described under African and African American Studies 88).\n\nIn 11X, Migration Stories (Identical to International Studies 17 and Film and Media Studies 47). With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries. We will also analyze how Hollywood cinema itself creates images and values that drive migration.

Using principles of both animation and editing, this course will explore the results of combination in cut and paste cinema in conjunction with the history of collage--from classic uses in painting, photomontage, architecture, and literature to contemporary functions via mash-ups, samples, and digital manipulation. Through producing projects, screening films, discussing readings, and writing papers, we will explore the varying formulations of new meanings via the pairing of found elements.\n\nIn 11W at 3A (Section 2), Independent American Film. This course examines the emergence and growth of the American Independent film movement from post-WW II to the present day. Working outside of and sometimes subversively within the Hollywood studio system, independents crafted films of an extraordinary variety across a wide spectrum of genres and styles. Despite a production and distribution system designed to exclude them, they prevailed in creating a compelling alternative vision to Hollywood’s increasingly homogenized mass entertainment. The course seeks to analyze and contextualize what it means to be an independent filmmaker, what an independent film actually is and why it matters. Students will be involved in the actual process of independent film through meeting visiting independent filmmakers and by conceptualizing, producing and budgeting an independent film of their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Handmade Strategies. This course will explore non-conventional, artisanal modes of experiments and avant-garde cinema that focus on the materiality of moving image media formats. By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries.

This class will look at the history of the Hollywood studio film production system, concentrating on its formation in the late teens and twenties through its greatest crises in the 1950s, and concluding with its survival as a system for television production and distribution for independent film companies from the 1950s to the present. The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump.

Drawing on ethical, religious or feminist perspectives, some have questioned the appropriateness of using these technologies. The issues/questions we will examine include the following: What is meant by “infertility”? What are appropriate ways of responding to it? What is the status of the embryos that are routinely manipulated (frozen, biopsied or destroyed) in this context? How are we to assess new approaches to resolving infertility, such as the use of donor eggs or surrogate parenting? Who should have access to these technologies and who should pay for them? What is the status of research on egg freezing, and how might its routine accomplishment change our society?

We will discover the biological capacities and the important social, family, and educational factors that, taken together, make this feat possible and establish the basic facts of language acquisition, involving children’s babbling, phonology, early vocabulary, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse knowledge, as well as their early gestural and pragmatic competence. Prevailing theoretical explanations and research methods will be explored. We will dispel the myths of how bilingual children acquire two languages from birth. We will leave our hearing-speaking modality and explore the world of language acquisition in total silence—regarding the acquisition of natural signed languages—as an innovative lens into the factors that are most key in acquiring all language.

What does humankind do to cause animal and plant extinctions? Is there a Biodiversity crisis? What is the current rate of extinction and what is the natural extinction rate? What properties of individual species make them vulnerable to extinction? What are the major threats to Biodiversity? The second objective is to examine the social dimensions of Biodiversity. How do our cultural and political perceptions and institutions contribute to the loss of Biodiversity? What value is Biodiversity to humankind? What is being done to preserve Biodiversity in the realms of science, technology, and policy?

This course surveys both the history and contemporary case studies of what is labeled “quality” television. This description spans across fiction, non-fiction, and “reality” formats, and can arise from critics, scholars, advocacy groups, or even the industry itself. As a result, the concept of “quality television” varies a great deal across history and especially within our contemporary media environment. Although our focus will be U.S. television, we will consider how the concept of “quality” is sometimes derived from comparisons with television outside the U.S. We will invite speakers who have worked in quality television and/or its histories. Students will be expected to contribute to a course blog, and write analytical papers, including a research paper.\n\nIn 12W at 11, Sound: Theory and Practice. Through the analysis of soundtracks and the creation of soundtracks, this course will explore the history of film sound and the way theories of sound reproduction continue to influence the development of sound technology and the practical choices made by sound recorders, sound mixers and editors.

Readings may include works by Sceve, Corneille, Laclos, Flaubert, Condé.\n\nIn 11W, The Joy of Literature. Reading can change desire, and redirecting desire can change the world. Reading can also introduce a degree of play into the landscape of desire and enable us to call into question the established order of things. The course studies the ways in which plays, essays, poetry and short stories can be interpreted and stimulate our desire.

The course will first consider the general theoretical concepts underlying empirical research, including the nature of causality, the structure and content of theories, and the formulation and testing of competing hypotheses. The course will then employ these concepts to develop several quantitative approaches to political analysis. Students will be introduced to two statistical methods frequently used by political scientists, contingency tables and linear regression. By learning to systematically analyze political data, students will gain the ability to better conduct and evaluate empirical research in both its quantitative and qualitative forms.

This course will introduce students to the study of elections and voting behavior.  Topics to be covered include partisanship in the electorate, voter turnout, nomination rules and procedures, campaign organization and strategy, and the effects of campaigns on voters.  Although we will focus on the United States, throughout the course comparisons will be made with other industrialized democracies in order to better understand the peculiar features of elections in the U.S.  The course will also provide a non-technical introduction to some of the methods used by political scientists to study public opinion, elections and voting behavior.  Because of the timing of the course, special attention will be paid to the results of the 2004 presidential and congressional elections and the outlook for the 2006 midterm elections.\n\nIn 12W at 10A, The Federal Budget. This course will investigate the U.S. federal budget. Students will come to understand the history of, contemporary practices in and future trajectory of U.S. expenditure and revenue generating policies. The course will also cover the process by which policymakers pass an annual budget including what is supposed to happen and what actually happens in pursuit of a budget compromise. Substantial course time will be spent considering possible reforms that can be made to the federal budget.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Law and Politics of the Environment. Although most Americans believe that environmental protection should be a policy priority, environmental regulation is routinely criticized for delivering only modest benefits at an exorbitant cost.  This course provides an overview of the development and current state of environmental law and policy in the United States, with special attention to the recurring technical and political challenges that frustrate policymakers’ attempts to solve environmental problems. Huber.\n\nIn 11W at 2A. The Presidency and the Public in American Politics. This is a course on the interaction between the president and the public. We will explore different theories about when and why the president might seek to alter policy in response to public attitudes as compared to when the president will seek to change public opinion. We will analyze the various techniques and strategies presidents use to understand public opinion in the current era, and the strategies they use to affect public views. We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms? How will politicians and businesses seek to understand and influence the preferences of the public as technological changes produce new opportunities and challenges regarding interactions with the public?

This course examines the modern politics of Iraq and the historical forces which have shaped contemporary Iraqi politics.  It covers Iraq’s formation in the aftermath of World War One, the British mandatory experience, Arab nationalism, Ba’thism and Saddam’s rule, as well as the 2003 invasion and its aftermath.  It examines the roles of sectarianism, ethnicity and tribalism, the impact of oil, and Iraq’s regional context.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Politics of Africa. This course examines post-colonial politics in sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on the events of the last decade. The course will be structured around three main themes: (1) patterns of economic growth and decline; (2) the transition to democratic political systems; and (3) political violence and civil conflict. While the course covers broad trends across the continent, it will also draw on case studies from particular countries.\n\nIn 11S at 12, Political Economy of the Arab Gulf States. For decades the Arab Gulf states—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—were viewed both economically and politically as anomalies, utterly dependent on world oil markets for their development, conservative if not backward, and marked by highly authoritarian regimes.  However, the creation within the region of the Gulf Cooperation Council as an economic bloc, and the emergence of Dubai as a post-oil financial and commercial center for the region, are clear indicators of the changing economic (and perhaps political) fortunes of the local countries.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Globalization and Global Development, The latest wave of economic globalization has differently affected various regions of the world. One of the most often repeated (and disputed) assertions is that the economic power of the United States is fading and that the fortunes of the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as well as other selected Emerging Economies (“the Second World”) will mark the dawn of a more equal and, economically speaking, a more balanced global economy. The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis—and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.","year":"2011","Professors":["Simon Chauchard"],"wc":"","CRN":"91439","note":"","dist":[],"enroll":""}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11209","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 10, 11 11W: 2A, 2 12W:10, 2A 12S: 10, 2A, 10A","avg_median":3.4675,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2","lab":"No","_rev":"31-448a63fd899561d309ab78d40a606d19","title":"What's So Civil About War","_id":"11209","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"02","Number":"050","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in International Relations not treated in the established curriculum.

Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.","year":"2011","Professors":["Bridget Coggins"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"11209","dist":["INT","SOC"],"enroll":"32"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"91756","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 10, 11 11W: 2A, 2 12W:10, 2A 12S: 10, 2A, 10A","avg_median":3.4675,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2","lab":"No","_rev":"31-a2378d28784916d9507b670bee75d8d5","title":"Human Rights & Int'l Relation","_id":"91756","nro":"false","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"03","Number":"050","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in International Relations not treated in the established curriculum.

Harvard Philosopher George Santayana said “those that cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (Life of Reason, 1905). Is that happening right now in Psychology? The goal of this course is to enrich our understanding of current psychological theory by understanding its intellectual origins. We will trace the origins of the current influential schools of thought in psychology to determine what is really new, and what was anticipated by earlier generations. We will see that early psychologists, without the aid of modern technologies, came up with some incredibly clever ways to solve experimental problems, many supplying answers that have held up to this day.

Our goal will be to shed light on ancient philosophical questions of free will, mental causation, and the mind-body problem by looking at what neuroscience can teach us. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Mind and Brain. It is believed that the mind is a manifestation of the brain. Think of computers. The brain is hardware, the mind is software. Is it possible to understand algorithms of the software by investigating physical activity of the hardware? This course will take the mind and brain problem as a theme to guide discussions about neural underpinnings of various mental phenomena. Cutting-edge research across Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind will be covered.\n\nIn 11S at 2, Attention. In our everyday environment, a massive amount of information pours into our sensory organs, but only a small subset of it reaches awareness. What determines how much information is passed on to higher levels of processing? In this course, we will explore this classic question of capacity limits on human information processing with particular emphasis on the role of attention.

For the Portuguese explorers, the 16th Century was a time of encounters with radical otherness. Their travels confronted them with physical and cultural realities that challenged every cultural assumption, every category of the real. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the first task of the discoverer was to organize a new vision, processing a flood of color, sound and light that threatened to overcome his resistance and impose a new autonomous system of perception and representation. His second task would be to come to grips with that radical otherness. Comparisons and contrasts would provide the first basic tool for “understanding” the Other and his world. They would also set the stage for legitimate appropriation of an ‘Other” that would be found lacing and inferior in the comparative process of apprehension. In mapping out the main processes that shape the colonial dynamics of seeing, knowing and appropriating during that period we will turn to the texts of Pero Vaz de Caminha, Pero de Magalhães Gândavo, Gabriel Soares de Sousa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto.","year":"2011","Professors":["Raul Bueno"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"10946","dist":[],"enroll":"12"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"10960","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"14","offered":"","avg_median":3.7025,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"21-2bdcdaad0b5075f190b2e69f5f689fac","title":"Public Speaking","_id":"10960","nro":"true","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"020","Department":"SPEE"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Joshua Compton"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"10960","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"13"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"90619","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"14","offered":"","avg_median":3.7025,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10A","lab":"No","_rev":"21-821e05e9b39de61da169c46184c0ca69","title":"Public Speaking","_id":"90619","nro":"true","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"020","Department":"SPEE"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Joshua Compton"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"90619","dist":["ART"],"enroll":""}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11413","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"10F: 10 11W: 12, 2A 11S: 10, 11 12S: 2","avg_median":3.8874999999999993,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"32-6254525b965c37cb5d5d2cb90e73f976","title":"Acting for Musical Theater","_id":"11413","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"010","Department":"THEA"}],"description":"In 10F at 10 Human Rights and Performance (Identical to Comparative Literature 34).

The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.","year":"2011","Professors":["Francis Magilligan"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"31993","dist":["SOC"],"enroll":"27"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"91466","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"40","offered":"Not offered in the period from 10F through 11X","avg_median":4.0,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"10-ac65454129cd69842da8f52e18846eed","title":"Educating Native Americans","_id":"91466","nro":"true","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"030","Department":"NAS"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Tsianina Lomawaima"],"wc":"","CRN":"91466","note":"","dist":[],"enroll":""}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"31107","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"50","offered":"11S: 12 12S: 2A","avg_median":3.33,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"12","lab":"No","_rev":"10-7d7a16dac582a2e727f4555cd8d7467c","title":"Ethical Theory","_id":"31107","nro":"true","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"037","Department":"PHIL"}],"description":"This course will be primarily concerned with such questions as What is morality?

Each course will emphasize a different combination of historical, theoretical, and new methodological approaches to one area of film studies.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (Section 1), Cut and Paste Cinema. Using principles of both animation and editing, this course will explore the results of combination in cut and paste cinema in conjunction with the history of collage--from classic uses in painting, photomontage, architecture, and literature to contemporary functions via mash-ups, samples, and digital manipulation. Through producing projects, screening films, discussing readings, and writing papers, we will explore the varying formulations of new meanings via the pairing of found elements.\n\nIn 11W at 3A (Section 2), Independent American Film. This course examines the emergence and growth of the American Independent film movement from post-WW II to the present day. Working outside of and sometimes subversively within the Hollywood studio system, independents crafted films of an extraordinary variety across a wide spectrum of genres and styles. Despite a production and distribution system designed to exclude them, they prevailed in creating a compelling alternative vision to Hollywood’s increasingly homogenized mass entertainment. The course seeks to analyze and contextualize what it means to be an independent filmmaker, what an independent film actually is and why it matters. Students will be involved in the actual process of independent film through meeting visiting independent filmmakers and by conceptualizing, producing and budgeting an independent film of their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Handmade Strategies. This course will explore non-conventional, artisanal modes of experiments and avant-garde cinema that focus on the materiality of moving image media formats. By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries. We will also analyze how Hollywood cinema itself creates images and values that drive migration. Gemunden, Spitta.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Jews and Hollywood. (Identical to, and described under, Jewish Studies 22.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 1), History of the Hollywood Studio System. This class will look at the history of the Hollywood studio film production system, concentrating on its formation in the late teens and twenties through its greatest crises in the 1950s, and concluding with its survival as a system for television production and distribution for independent film companies from the 1950s to the present. The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump.

Over a century ago W.E.B. DuBois wrote that “the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line” (1903). In the first decade of the 21st century, race remains one of the most salient features of the American experience and social geography. News of racial tensions, racial disparities in the quality of life, racial divides in public opinion, and beatings and killings based on racial animosity continue to surface regularly. The underlying message seems to be that race is conflict and if we want a good society, whether national or local, we should avoid the subject or at the very least, deflect it in favor of discussing ethnicity and social class instead.

Enrollment limited to 35 students.\n\nIn 11W at 12, Evolutionary Psychology. In this course we examine the human mind and behavior from a broad evolutionary perspective. We start by covering the main principles of evolution and Darwin’s most extraordinary insight: the evolution of all species from a single, common ancestor. Then we make the important causal connection to our minds by building up from genes to mind. We next consider how sex and reproductive strategies influence male and female behavior in a variety of species, including humans. We then examine the evolutionary influences on family life, and look to child development for evidence of innate knowledge. Limitations in our cognitive processing, and universals in social and emotional processing provide further evidence for evolved adaptations. Throughout the course, we will consider how the most enigmatic and compelling of human qualities, such as love, aggression, morality and culture, are influenced by our evolutionary history.

This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2). We define and transform ourselves through stories. In this community-based learning course, students will alternate studying narratives of prison, addiction, and recovery in the traditional classroom with travel to Valley Vista, a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Bradford, Vermont, where they will participate in a program for women patients whose goal is the creation and performance of an original production that will facilitate the patients’ voices. Written work for the course will combine critical analysis and self-reflection.\n\nIn 11W at 11 (section 3), Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native Literature and Film (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 32).\n\nIn 11S at 11 (section 4), Woolfenstein (Identical to WGST 53). In her well known passage from A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf stated that “we think back through our mothers if we are women”; twenty years later, Gertrude Stein would obliquely refer to herself as “the mother of us all.” These two women occupy a central place in European and American modernism, their work having influenced successive generations of writers. Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory. Suggested background courses are English 15, Comparative Literature 72, WGST 16.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 5), African Literatures: Masterpieces of Literature From Africa (Identical to African and African American Studies 51 and Comparative Literature 51. Described under Comparative Literature 51).\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 9), Faulkner. In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. Readings include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and other.\n\nSeminars are designed as small courses, limited to twelve students, primarily seniors; qualified juniors may enroll. These courses emphasize discussion, and allow the student to develop his or her thinking about a subject throughout the term. Though assignments vary according to the nature of the material being studied, seminars usually involve class presentations and a term paper. They fulfill the “Culminating Experience” requirement. Prerequisite: at least four completed major courses, of which one must be in the same course group as the seminar. Students who successfully complete a seminar may sometimes be allowed to follow it with a one-term Honors project (see the section on Honors, above).","year":"2011","Professors":["Ayo Coly"],"wc":"NW","note":"","CRN":"31203","dist":["INT","LIT"],"enroll":"19"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"60233","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"11W: 9; Laboratory Tu,Th 11X: 9L; Laboratory 12W: 9; Laboratory Tu,Th 12X: 10; Laboratory","avg_median":3.2640000000000002,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10","lab":"Yes","_rev":"14-e3850d6ea0a563f60cb3715085add7ad","title":"Systems","_id":"60233","nro":"true","term":"Summer","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"022","Department":"ENGS"}],"description":"The student is introduced to the techniques of modeling and analyzing lumped systems of a variety of types, including electrical, mechanical, reacting, fluid, and thermal systems.

Students will come to understand the history of, contemporary practices in and future trajectory of U.S. expenditure and revenue generating policies. The course will also cover the process by which policymakers pass an annual budget including what is supposed to happen and what actually happens in pursuit of a budget compromise. Substantial course time will be spent considering possible reforms that can be made to the federal budget.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Law and Politics of the Environment. Although most Americans believe that environmental protection should be a policy priority, environmental regulation is routinely criticized for delivering only modest benefits at an exorbitant cost.  This course provides an overview of the development and current state of environmental law and policy in the United States, with special attention to the recurring technical and political challenges that frustrate policymakers’ attempts to solve environmental problems. Huber.\n\nIn 11W at 2A. The Presidency and the Public in American Politics. This is a course on the interaction between the president and the public. We will explore different theories about when and why the president might seek to alter policy in response to public attitudes as compared to when the president will seek to change public opinion. We will analyze the various techniques and strategies presidents use to understand public opinion in the current era, and the strategies they use to affect public views. We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms? How will politicians and businesses seek to understand and influence the preferences of the public as technological changes produce new opportunities and challenges regarding interactions with the public?

This course examines the modern politics of Iraq and the historical forces which have shaped contemporary Iraqi politics.  It covers Iraq’s formation in the aftermath of World War One, the British mandatory experience, Arab nationalism, Ba’thism and Saddam’s rule, as well as the 2003 invasion and its aftermath.  It examines the roles of sectarianism, ethnicity and tribalism, the impact of oil, and Iraq’s regional context.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Politics of Africa. This course examines post-colonial politics in sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on the events of the last decade. The course will be structured around three main themes: (1) patterns of economic growth and decline; (2) the transition to democratic political systems; and (3) political violence and civil conflict. While the course covers broad trends across the continent, it will also draw on case studies from particular countries.\n\nIn 11S at 12, Political Economy of the Arab Gulf States. For decades the Arab Gulf states—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—were viewed both economically and politically as anomalies, utterly dependent on world oil markets for their development, conservative if not backward, and marked by highly authoritarian regimes.  However, the creation within the region of the Gulf Cooperation Council as an economic bloc, and the emergence of Dubai as a post-oil financial and commercial center for the region, are clear indicators of the changing economic (and perhaps political) fortunes of the local countries.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Globalization and Global Development, The latest wave of economic globalization has differently affected various regions of the world. One of the most often repeated (and disputed) assertions is that the economic power of the United States is fading and that the fortunes of the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as well as other selected Emerging Economies (“the Second World”) will mark the dawn of a more equal and, economically speaking, a more balanced global economy. The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis—and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.","year":"2011","Professors":["Diederik Vandewalle"],"wc":"NW","CRN":"31068","note":"","dist":["INT","SOC"],"enroll":"38"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"10207","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 10, 11 11W: 2A, 2 12W:10, 2A 12S: 10, 2A, 10A","avg_median":3.4675,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"31-b7033598725dec3d0182422d1b4cd820","title":"IR of East Asia","_id":"10207","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"050","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in International Relations not treated in the established curriculum.

Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jennifer Lind"],"wc":"NW","note":"","CRN":"10207","dist":["INT","SOC"],"enroll":"32"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"90247","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 10, 11 11W: 2A, 2 12W:10, 2A 12S: 10, 2A, 10A","avg_median":3.4675,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"11","lab":"No","_rev":"31-ca52bf0455c090d013fa8f6675c7c62f","title":"Consequences of Globalization","_id":"90247","nro":"false","term":"Fall","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"050","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in International Relations not treated in the established curriculum.

We will discover the biological capacities and the important social, family, and educational factors that, taken together, make this feat pos-sible and establish the basic facts of language acquisition, involving children’s babbling, phonology, early vocabulary, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse knowledge, as well as their early gestural and pragmatic competence. Prevailing theoretical explanations and research methods will be explored. We will dispel myths of how bilingual children acquire two languages from birth. We will leave our hearing-speaking modality and explore the world of language acquisition in total silence regarding the acquisition of natural signed languages—as innovative lens into the factors that are most key in acquiring all language. Critically, we will evaluate the efficacy of how language is presently taught to young children in schools in light of the facts of human language acquisition.

For the Portuguese explorers, the 16th Century was a time of encounters with radical otherness. Their travels confronted them with physical and cultural realities that challenged every cultural assumption, every category of the real. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the first task of the discoverer was to organize a new vision, processing a flood of color, sound and light that threatened to overcome his resistance and impose a new autonomous system of perception and representation. His second task would be to come to grips with that radical otherness. Comparisons and contrasts would provide the first basic tool for “understanding” the Other and his world. They would also set the stage for legitimate appropriation of an ‘Other” that would be found lacing and inferior in the comparative process of apprehension. In mapping out the main processes that shape the colonial dynamics of seeing, knowing and appropriating during that period we will turn to the texts of Pero Vaz de Caminha, Pero de Magalhães Gândavo, Gabriel Soares de Sousa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto.","year":"2011","Professors":["Isabel Lozano-Renieblas"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"90110","dist":[],"enroll":""}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"32174","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"16","offered":"Consult special listings","avg_median":3.594,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"11","lab":"No","_rev":"19-0125cae37eceb101edf07f663d3c6d2f","title":"Theater for Social Change","_id":"32174","nro":"false","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"007","Department":"THEA"}],"description":"","year":"2011","Professors":["Mara Sabinson"],"wc":"","note":"","CRN":"32174","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"15"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"31950","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"10F: 10A, 2A 10W, 10S: 10A 11F: 10A, 2A 12W: 10A 12S: 10A","avg_median":3.9622222222222216,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10A","lab":"No","_rev":"25-e045888cae510dad5611d65f9e228475","title":"Acting I","_id":"31950","nro":"false","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"030","Department":"THEA"}],"description":"Basic introduction to acting technique for the stage.

Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult.

This course will examine some of the major texts in the field, including the roots of contemporary critical practices in philosophy, linguistics, and semiotics, as well as some of the latest, “cutting edge” applications of theory to all kinds of cultural “objects”: texts, films, clothes, bodies, genders, identities, buildings, cities, nations, etc. Works by Saussure, Jakobson, Foucault, Lacan, Benjamin, Derrida, Hegel, Butler, Venturi, Kohlhaas and others.\n\nIn 11F, Literary Theory: Entering the Conversation. Disparate theories of literature have shared a certain number of fundamental questions since long before the twentieth century: what is a text? what is an author? what is a reader? what is context? How does literature itself imply theoretical concepts? By studying a range of different answers, we will seek to formulate productive questions. How can we use these questions to join critical conversations already under way among established scholars?

Enrollment limited to 35 students.\n\nIn 11W at 12, Evolutionary Psychology. In this course we examine the human mind and behavior from a broad evolutionary perspective. We start by covering the main principles of evolution and Darwin’s most extraordinary insight: the evolution of all species from a single, common ancestor. Then we make the important causal connection to our minds by building up from genes to mind. We next consider how sex and reproductive strategies influence male and female behavior in a variety of species, including humans. We then examine the evolutionary influences on family life, and look to child development for evidence of innate knowledge. Limitations in our cognitive processing, and universals in social and emotional processing provide further evidence for evolved adaptations. Throughout the course, we will consider how the most enigmatic and compelling of human qualities, such as love, aggression, morality and culture, are influenced by our evolutionary history.

Diego Velasquez, sometimes called the prince of painters, was Spain’s preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV. The class will study in depth many of Velazquez’s key works and examine how he challenged previous notions about the nature of representation, and simultaneously sought to demonstrate the “nobility” of painting.\n\nIn 11W, “The Villa Life”: Andrea Palladio and His Architectural Legacy. Historians routinely identify Andrea Palladio, the 16th-century Italian architect, as architecture’s most celebrated designer. For one who never left Italy and whose reputation depends on a small number of built works and the repeated publication and translation of a single book, such abiding esteem is an astonishing achievement. In this course, we will study Palladio’s splendid Veneto villas and his influential Four Books of Architecture in search of the reasons for his great prominence.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 10A, Books as Art: Renaissance and Baroque Illustrated Books at Dartmouth. This class examines rare illustrated books in the rich collection in Dartmouth’s Rauner Library. We will focus on the necessity or effectiveness of book illustration, the relation between text and image, book illustrations as works of art and as conveyors of knowledge. Students will study first-hand rare atlases, natural histories, medical books, minuscule prayer books, and illustrated volumes of Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Ovid. We will also take up the subject of bibliophiles and bibliomania.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 2, Abstract Expressionism. Abstract Expressionism, the first American artistic movement to gain international recognition, embodied many conflicts and paradoxes. Steeping themselves in earlier European modernism, the artists nonetheless pursued a style that was to be a-historical in its immediacy. They aimed to address the most profound questions of civilization solely through acts of spontaneity. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Pollock, Gorky, DeKooning, Rothko, and others amidst the complexities of American culture of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 11F, Mexican Muralism (identical to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies 48). This survey course introduces students to Mexican muralism.  Students will learn about the fresco technique and how to visually analyze a mural.  We will consider the following themes: cultural nationalism; art and class politics; the legacy of muralism in the US; the ethics of aesthetic indigenism; and the gender politics of public art. Student projects will concentrate of Jose Clemente Orozco’s mural at Dartmouth College. \n\nIn 12S, The Blue Rider Group. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) was an international group of expressionists whose work was centered in Munich, around 1912. The class will study the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc, August Macke, and Paul Klee; the group’s exhibitions; and the wide-ranging theoretical statements they published in fin-de-siècle, pre-war Munich. ","year":"2011","Professors":["Joy Kenseth"],"wc":"W","CRN":"30617","note":"","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"11"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11718","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"","offered":"11F: 10A","avg_median":3.66,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"10","lab":"No","_rev":"14-bb72fbd1c2a24f8f2988b84ae10beb70","title":"Art of Greece:Prehist/Clas","_id":"11718","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"01","Number":"021","Department":"ARTH"}],"description":"The course treats chronologically the history of Greek art from its beginnings to the end of the fifth century B.C.

Genetic variation underlies much of the diseases that afflict us, but how do differences at the level of DNA translate into differences in health? How can we find genes underlying such disorders? In “DNA to Disease” we will focus on a small number of human genetic diseases, some of which are caused by defects in a single gene while others result from defects in multiple genes.

This course examines the book as a material and cultural object. We’ll consider various practical and theoretical models for understanding the book form and investigating the materials, technologies, institutions, and practices of its production, dissemination, and reception. We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also spend time talking about the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience in the Book Arts workshop setting type.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 3), Evidence of Things Not Seen: Advanced Creative Nonfiction. Through close readings of creative nonfiction, we’ll investigate craft—character, voice, structure, and sequence—as well as parable, myth, and allusion, the intangible “facts” at the heart of the genre. We’ll conduct our inquiry through excursions into faith, doubt, and the territory in between. Our goal is to learn how to inhabit the ideas and experience of “belief,” broadly defined, an essential step in writing nonfiction stories that transcend their journalistic foundations.\n\nIn 11W at 2 (section 4), The Poetics of Literary Practice. Designed for students interested in the intersections of literary study, theory, and the practice of creative writing, this course explores how modern and contemporary poets have thought about their own art. How do underlying theories about language, art, culture, and history inform a poet’s literary practice? Students will develop their own creative and critical writing practices, participate in workshop critique, compose responses to the selected readings, and complete an essay that explores their own poetics.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (section 5), Some Elements of Drama. Traversing ten plays and a range of critical responses to theater and performance, the course entertains questions concerning the purpose of theater, the fascination and anxiety it occasions, and the complex dynamics among players, playgoers and playtexts, exploring what drama does for—and to—audiences. A playlist including Sophocles and Shakespeare, but also Beckett, Pirandello, Pinter and Churchill, challenges and expands upon issues raised by theorists from Plato’s time to the present.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 6), Writers at Work. This course will explore how cultural stories shape the identities of writers and inform their work. We will read writers on their writing process, looking at how their contexts inform and shape their stories. We will read and discuss such writers as: Toni Morrison, J.D. Salinger, T. Olsen, W. Faulkner, and T.T. Williams. The overarching goal of the course will be to help students to develop a concrete writing process, gaining voice and self-consciousness within their own cultural stories. Students will be encouraged to write not only about other writers’ writing process but about their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 7), The Poem in Context. A noted American writer allegedly boasted, “I don’t read books; I write them.” This course is for another kind of writer, the kind who ponders questions such as: what happens in a poem? why do some move us so intensely that we learn them by heart? how do they change the way we think? As we write and read 20th century poems, we will reflect on the assumptions that shape them and will examine their historical and social contexts. As we write and read theory and criticism, we will try to make the practical and theoretical aspects of the art cohere.","year":"2011","Professors":["Gary Lenhart"],"wc":"","CRN":"32125","note":"","dist":["ART"],"enroll":"11"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"32276","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"30","offered":"10F: 10A, 2A 11W: 11 11S: 11, 10A, 2A","avg_median":3.609230769230768,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"26-ac4a74949416ee70bf0433e961662c98","title":"Faulkner","_id":"32276","nro":"true","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"09","Number":"067","Department":"ENGL"}],"description":"In 10F at 10A (section 1), Contemporary American Poetry. This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2). We define and transform ourselves through stories. In this community-based learning course, students will alternate studying narratives of prison, addiction, and recovery in the traditional classroom with travel to Valley Vista, a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Bradford, Vermont, where they will participate in a program for women patients whose goal is the creation and performance of an original production that will facilitate the patients’ voices. Written work for the course will combine critical analysis and self-reflection.\n\nIn 11W at 11 (section 3), Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native Literature and Film (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 32).\n\nIn 11S at 11 (section 4), Woolfenstein (Identical to WGST 53). In her well known passage from A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf stated that “we think back through our mothers if we are women”; twenty years later, Gertrude Stein would obliquely refer to herself as “the mother of us all.” These two women occupy a central place in European and American modernism, their work having influenced successive generations of writers. Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory. Suggested background courses are English 15, Comparative Literature 72, WGST 16.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 5), African Literatures: Masterpieces of Literature From Africa (Identical to African and African American Studies 51 and Comparative Literature 51. Described under Comparative Literature 51).\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 9), Faulkner. In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. Readings include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and other.\n\nSeminars are designed as small courses, limited to twelve students, primarily seniors; qualified juniors may enroll. These courses emphasize discussion, and allow the student to develop his or her thinking about a subject throughout the term.

This course will investigate the U.S. federal budget. Students will come to understand the history of, contemporary practices in and future trajectory of U.S. expenditure and revenue generating policies. The course will also cover the process by which policymakers pass an annual budget including what is supposed to happen and what actually happens in pursuit of a budget compromise. Substantial course time will be spent considering possible reforms that can be made to the federal budget.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Law and Politics of the Environment. Although most Americans believe that environmental protection should be a policy priority, environmental regulation is routinely criticized for delivering only modest benefits at an exorbitant cost.  This course provides an overview of the development and current state of environmental law and policy in the United States, with special attention to the recurring technical and political challenges that frustrate policymakers’ attempts to solve environmental problems. Huber.\n\nIn 11W at 2A. The Presidency and the Public in American Politics. This is a course on the interaction between the president and the public. We will explore different theories about when and why the president might seek to alter policy in response to public attitudes as compared to when the president will seek to change public opinion. We will analyze the various techniques and strategies presidents use to understand public opinion in the current era, and the strategies they use to affect public views. We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms? How will politicians and businesses seek to understand and influence the preferences of the public as technological changes produce new opportunities and challenges regarding interactions with the public?

This course examines the modern politics of Iraq and the historical forces which have shaped contemporary Iraqi politics.  It covers Iraq’s formation in the aftermath of World War One, the British mandatory experience, Arab nationalism, Ba’thism and Saddam’s rule, as well as the 2003 invasion and its aftermath.  It examines the roles of sectarianism, ethnicity and tribalism, the impact of oil, and Iraq’s regional context.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Politics of Africa. This course examines post-colonial politics in sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on the events of the last decade. The course will be structured around three main themes: (1) patterns of economic growth and decline; (2) the transition to democratic political systems; and (3) political violence and civil conflict. While the course covers broad trends across the continent, it will also draw on case studies from particular countries.\n\nIn 11S at 12, Political Economy of the Arab Gulf States. For decades the Arab Gulf states—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—were viewed both economically and politically as anomalies, utterly dependent on world oil markets for their development, conservative if not backward, and marked by highly authoritarian regimes.  However, the creation within the region of the Gulf Cooperation Council as an economic bloc, and the emergence of Dubai as a post-oil financial and commercial center for the region, are clear indicators of the changing economic (and perhaps political) fortunes of the local countries.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Globalization and Global Development, The latest wave of economic globalization has differently affected various regions of the world. One of the most often repeated (and disputed) assertions is that the economic power of the United States is fading and that the fortunes of the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as well as other selected Emerging Economies (“the Second World”) will mark the dawn of a more equal and, economically speaking, a more balanced global economy. The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis—and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.","year":"2011","Professors":["Jeremy Horowitz"],"wc":"NW","CRN":"11681","note":"","dist":["INT","SOC"],"enroll":"25"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"32322","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"35","offered":"10F: 2A 11S, 12W: 12","avg_median":3.377142857142857,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"24-8739d89e9abea41facb755a7d2419814","title":"Democracy European Style","_id":"32322","nro":"false","term":"Spring","names":[{"Section":"02","Number":"040","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in Regional Politics not treated in the established curriculum.

Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.","year":"2011","Professors":["Daryl Press"],"wc":"","CRN":"31209","note":"","dist":["SOC"],"enroll":"28"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"courses","_id":"11213","_score":1.0, "_source" : {"limit":"14","offered":"","avg_median":3.66,"type":"Dartmouth","period":"2A","lab":"No","_rev":"31-fedba874b9df64955b489b53168072d4","title":"Lawyers and Public Policy","_id":"11213","nro":"false","term":"Winter","names":[{"Section":"04","Number":"081","Department":"GOVT"}],"description":"Counterfactuals and International Relations.

Harvard Philosopher George Santayana said “those that cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (Life of Reason, 1905). Is that happening right now in Psychology? The goal of this course is to enrich our understanding of current psychological theory by understanding its intellectual origins. We will trace the origins of the current influential schools of thought in psychology to determine what is really new, and what was anticipated by earlier generations. We will see that early psychologists, without the aid of modern technologies, came up with some incredibly clever ways to solve experimental problems, many supplying answers that have held up to this day.

Our goal will be to shed light on ancient philosophical questions of free will, mental causation, and the mind-body problem by looking at what neuroscience can teach us. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Mind and Brain. It is believed that the mind is a manifestation of the brain. Think of computers. The brain is hardware, the mind is software. Is it possible to understand algorithms of the software by investigating physical activity of the hardware? This course will take the mind and brain problem as a theme to guide discussions about neural underpinnings of various mental phenomena. Cutting-edge research across Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind will be covered.\n\nIn 11S at 2, Attention. In our everyday environment, a massive amount of information pours into our sensory organs, but only a small subset of it reaches awareness. What determines how much information is passed on to higher levels of processing? In this course, we will explore this classic question of capacity limits on human information processing with particular emphasis on the role of attention. Through lectures and discussions, we will examine the cognitive and neural mechanisms of attention.

Understanding the nature of self-what it is and what it does-has challenged scholars for many centuries. Although most people intuitively understand what is meant by the term self, definitions have tended toward the philosophical and metaphysical. Efforts at creating more formal definitions have largely been unsuccessful, as many features of self are empirically murky, difficult to identify and assess using objective methods. Yet the phenomenological experience of self is highly familiar to everyone. So, at issue is not whether the self exists, but how best to study it. This course will survey contemporary approaches to understanding the self, with a strong emphasis on approaches from social psychology. We will consider self’s development, its cognitive and affective components, motives related to it, and how it is regulated. We will consider its functional basis, examining both its adaptive and maladaptive consequences. We will also examine its neurological basis, including case studies of people with disorders of self.
