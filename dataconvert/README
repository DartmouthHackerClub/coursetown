convert-from-old produces a series of INSERT statements.
schema.sql is the basic schema (that convert-from-old( wants, imported from courseguide and adapted to sqlite3)


HOWTO:
make a file called "password" and put the root password in.
Copy empty sqlite3 to development.sqlite3
./convert-from-old.sh | sqlite3 development.sqlite3
Now you have lots of stuff
